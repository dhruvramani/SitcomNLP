Monica |  | 00:00:05,872 | 00:00:08,773

Carol |  | 00:00:28,194 | 00:00:31,459

Carol | You know, it's... | 00:00:32,599 | 00:00:34,157

Carol | Something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. | 00:00:37,203 | 00:00:40,195

Carol | I gotta get one too. | 00:00:41,508 | 00:00:43,169

Carol | Hey, what are you guys doing? | 00:00:45,912 | 00:00:47,743

Carol | We're just hanging out by the spoons. | 00:00:48,081 | 00:00:50,447

Carol | Ladle? Will you guys grow up? | 00:00:51,151 | 00:00:53,946

Carol | This is the most nature beautiful thing in the world. | 00:00:54,187 | 00:00:56,951

Carol | Yeah, we know. But there's a baby sucking on it. | 00:00:57,223 | 00:01:00,192

Carol | This is my son having lunch, okay? It'll happen a lot, so get used to it. | 00:01:02,395 | 00:01:07,526

Chandler | You know, it's... | 00:00:32,599 | 00:00:34,157

Chandler | Something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. | 00:00:37,203 | 00:00:40,195

Chandler | I gotta get one too. | 00:00:41,508 | 00:00:43,169

Chandler | We're just hanging out by the spoons. | 00:00:48,081 | 00:00:50,447

Chandler | Ladle? Will you guys grow up? | 00:00:51,151 | 00:00:53,946

Chandler | This is the most nature beautiful thing in the world. | 00:00:54,187 | 00:00:56,951

Chandler | Yeah, we know. But there's a baby sucking on it. | 00:00:57,223 | 00:01:00,192

Chandler | This is my son having lunch, okay? It'll happen a lot, so get used to it. | 00:01:02,395 | 00:01:07,526

Chandler | If you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it. | 00:01:08,068 | 00:01:13,298

Chandler | Carol? | 00:01:16,342 | 00:01:17,138

Chandler | I'm wondering, could Joey ask you a question about breast-feeding? | 00:01:20,146 | 00:01:23,775

Chandler | Sure. | 00:01:26,286 | 00:01:27,218

Chandler | Does it hurt? | 00:01:29,756 | 00:01:31,155

Chandler | It did at first, but not anymore. | 00:01:32,459 | 00:01:34,927

Chandler | Chandler? | 00:01:35,361 | 00:01:36,385

Chandler | So, how often can you do it? | 00:01:39,365 | 00:01:41,333

Chandler | As much as he needs. | 00:01:42,001 | 00:01:43,400

Chandler | Okay, I got one, I got one. | 00:01:44,204 | 00:01:46,695

Chandler | If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger? | 00:01:49,042 | 00:01:52,068

Chandler | The One With the Breast Milk - Any muffins left? - Yeah, I forget which ones. You're busy, I'll get it. - Anyone else want one? - No, thanks. You're losing your apron. Let me get it. | 00:01:55,882 | 00:02:53,037

Chandler | - There you go. - Thank you. | 00:02:54,107 | 00:02:56,007

Chandler | What a bitch! I have a friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting... ...and he wants to abuse his discount. Anyone want to come take advantage of it? I have to take my grandmother to the vet. | 00:02:57,777 | 00:03:13,885

Chandler | - I'll go with you. - Great. | 00:03:18,631 | 00:03:20,326

Chandler | - Hi, honey. - Hey, sweetums. | 00:03:23,369 | 00:03:25,098

Chandler | And hello to the rest. | 00:03:26,206 | 00:03:28,401

Chandler | You can't go shopping with her. What about Rachel? | 00:03:31,177 | 00:03:34,806

Chandler | Will it be a problem? | 00:03:35,748 | 00:03:36,942

Chandler | You're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie. It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship. | 00:03:37,183 | 00:03:42,977

Chandler | Monica, she will kill you. | 00:03:44,524 | 00:03:46,116

Chandler | She will kill you like a dog in the street! | 00:03:47,827 | 00:03:50,489

Chandler | So Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow. | 00:03:55,101 | 00:03:58,696

Chandler | It's actually not that big a deal. | 00:03:59,372 | 00:04:01,932

Chandler | It's a big deal to me. This is great. I really appreciate this. You're welcome. | 00:04:02,242 | 00:04:08,280

Chandler | Bijan for men? | 00:04:23,129 | 00:04:24,357

Chandler | Bijan for men? | 00:04:25,832 | 00:04:27,060

Chandler | - Hey, Annabel. - Hey, Joey. Did you hear about the new guy? | 00:04:30,803 | 00:04:34,798

Chandler | Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls call him "The Hombre Man." | 00:04:35,108 | 00:04:39,477

Chandler | Hombre? | 00:04:48,921 | 00:04:50,286

Chandler | What's he doing in my section? I guess he doesn't know. Well, he's gonna. | 00:04:55,128 | 00:05:01,190

Chandler | I'll see you a little later, okay? | 00:05:02,302 | 00:05:04,293

Chandler | Hey, how you doing? Mornin'. | 00:05:07,607 | 00:05:10,574

Chandler | Listen, I know you're new... ...but it's understood that everything... | 00:05:11,477 | 00:05:16,876

Chandler | ...from young men's to the escalator is my territory. | 00:05:17,083 | 00:05:20,519

Chandler | "Your territory"? | 00:05:22,221 | 00:05:24,246

Chandler | - Bijan for men? - No, thanks. Hombre? | 00:05:25,625 | 00:05:28,892

Chandler | Yeah, all right. | 00:05:29,228 | 00:05:31,355

Chandler | You were saying? | 00:05:38,137 | 00:05:39,195

Chandler | Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. | 00:05:43,242 | 00:05:47,178

Chandler | We shopped and we had lunch. | 00:05:48,147 | 00:05:49,705

Chandler | What did I have? - You had a salad. - No wonder I don't feel full. | 00:05:50,016 | 00:05:55,116

Chandler | Hi. What's up? I went shopping with Monica and I had a salad. | 00:05:56,322 | 00:06:00,625

Chandler | Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? | 00:06:02,895 | 00:06:05,090

Chandler | We went shopping for... For... | 00:06:06,666 | 00:06:10,627

Chandler | For fur. | 00:06:11,070 | 00:06:12,833

Chandler | You went shopping for fur? | 00:06:15,408 | 00:06:17,968

Chandler | And then I realized that I'm against that. | 00:06:19,112 | 00:06:21,706

Chandler | So then we bought some... | 00:06:23,116 | 00:06:25,243

Chandler | Boobs. | 00:06:26,686 | 00:06:27,778

Chandler | You bought boobs? | 00:06:33,693 | 00:06:34,591

Chandler | Bras! | 00:06:37,864 | 00:06:39,388

Chandler | We bought bras! | 00:06:40,266 | 00:06:41,358

Chandler | We bought bras. | 00:06:42,368 | 00:06:44,529

Chandler | Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... | 00:06:47,673 | 00:06:52,776

Chandler | Hey, Annabel. | 00:06:54,714 | 00:06:55,738

Chandler | I was wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee? Actually, I sort of have plans. | 00:06:56,182 | 00:07:02,654

Chandler | You ready, Annabel? | 00:07:07,994 | 00:07:09,552

Chandler | You bet. | 00:07:10,930 | 00:07:12,363

Chandler | Maybe some other time. | 00:07:14,167 | 00:07:15,395

Chandler | It's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? | 00:07:26,112 | 00:07:31,849

Chandler | Bijan for men! | 00:07:32,318 | 00:07:33,910

Chandler | And this is Funny Clown. It's only for after his naps, not before, or he won't sleep. We've been through this before. We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. | 00:07:35,488 | 00:07:48,229

Chandler | Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. | 00:07:50,102 | 00:07:57,274

Chandler | This is so cute! I got that for him! | 00:07:59,345 | 00:08:02,905

Chandler | "My Mommies Love Me." | 00:08:03,216 | 00:08:04,683

Chandler | That's clever. | 00:08:08,621 | 00:08:10,145

Chandler | Oh, hi, Jul... | 00:08:12,792 | 00:08:14,487

Chandler | Hi, Jew! | 00:08:15,895 | 00:08:17,328

Chandler | Okay, sure. That'd be great. See you then. Bye. | 00:08:22,268 | 00:08:26,599

Chandler | Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"? | 00:08:27,073 | 00:08:29,098

Chandler | Yes, I did. That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz. | 00:08:34,146 | 00:08:37,941

Chandler | Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. | 00:08:46,526 | 00:08:49,290

Chandler | Ben, dinner! | 00:08:54,734 | 00:08:56,702

Chandler | Thanks, Aunt Pheebs. Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk. | 00:08:57,637 | 00:09:02,741

Chandler | I think I know how to heat breast milk. | 00:09:03,009 | 00:09:05,876

Chandler | What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk! So? Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person. | 00:09:09,649 | 00:09:21,121

Chandler | What is the big deal? | 00:09:22,828 | 00:09:24,819

Chandler | What did you just do? | 00:09:26,966 | 00:09:28,797

Chandler | Can people stop drinking the breast milk? | 00:09:30,903 | 00:09:34,304

Chandler | You won't even taste it? | 00:09:35,908 | 00:09:37,500

Chandler | Not even if you just pretend it's milk? Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. | 00:09:39,011 | 00:09:45,608

Chandler | - Where is everybody? - At the park. Where have you been? | 00:09:53,392 | 00:09:56,759

Chandler | Just out. Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me. | 00:09:57,363 | 00:10:02,864

Chandler | - Thanks for your jacket. - No problem. | 00:10:04,236 | 00:10:05,965

Chandler | You can borrow it, by the way. | 00:10:06,739 | 00:10:09,037

Chandler | Here are your keys, honey. | 00:10:10,276 | 00:10:12,107

Chandler | If you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53? | 00:10:16,115 | 00:10:19,915

Chandler | You know what probably happened? Someone stole my credit card. | 00:10:23,289 | 00:10:27,419

Chandler | And put the receipt back in your pocket? | 00:10:29,528 | 00:10:31,758

Joey |  | 00:21:47,472 | 00:21:48,734

Ross |  | 00:03:31,177 | 00:03:34,806

Joey |  | 00:00:57,223 | 00:01:00,192

Carol | It did at first, but not anymore. | 00:01:32,459 | 00:01:34,927

Carol | As much as he needs. | 00:01:42,001 | 00:01:43,400

Rachel |  | 00:02:42,395 | 00:02:45,193

Julie |  | 00:16:49,608 | 00:16:52,441

Rachel |  | 00:02:54,107 | 00:02:56,007

Rachel | What a bitch! | 00:02:57,777 | 00:02:59,540

Chandler |  | 00:13:27,339 | 00:13:28,328

Phoebe | Monica, she will kill you. | 00:03:44,524 | 00:03:46,116

Phoebe | She will kill you like a dog in the street! | 00:03:47,827 | 00:03:50,489

Ross |  | 00:13:31,343 | 00:13:34,176

Ross | It's a big deal to me. I really appreciate this. | 00:04:02,242 | 00:04:06,545

Annabelle |  Did you hear about the new guy? | 00:04:30,803 | 00:04:34,798

Joey |  | 00:04:55,128 | 00:04:57,426

Annabelle | I guess he doesn't know. | 00:04:57,664 | 00:04:59,325

Joey |  ...but it's understood that everything... | 00:05:11,477 | 00:05:16,876

Joey | ...from young men's to the escalator is my territory. | 00:05:17,083 | 00:05:20,519

Hombre Man |  | 00:05:43,242 | 00:05:47,178

Monica | Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. | 00:05:43,242 | 00:05:47,178

Phoebe | I went shopping with Monica and I had a salad. | 00:05:57,690 | 00:06:00,625

Rachel | Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? | 00:06:02,895 | 00:06:05,090

Rachel | You went shopping for fur? | 00:06:15,408 | 00:06:17,968

Phoebe |  | 00:00:05,872 | 00:00:08,773

Phoebe | ...in 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist! | 00:00:09,009 | 00:00:11,705

Phoebe | Look at these. Hey, Ben. | 00:00:15,582 | 00:00:18,883

Phoebe | "Just do it"! | 00:00:19,119 | 00:00:20,746

Phoebe | Oh, my God! Was that too much pressure for him? | 00:00:22,956 | 00:00:26,415

Phoebe | - Is he hungry already? - I guess so. | 00:00:28,194 | 00:00:31,459

Phoebe | You know, it's... | 00:00:32,599 | 00:00:34,157

Phoebe | Something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. | 00:00:37,203 | 00:00:40,195

Phoebe | I gotta get one too. | 00:00:41,508 | 00:00:43,169

Phoebe | Hey, what are you guys doing? | 00:00:45,912 | 00:00:47,743

Phoebe | We're just hanging out by the spoons. | 00:00:48,081 | 00:00:50,447

Phoebe | Hi. What's up? I went shopping with Monica and I had a salad. | 00:05:56,322 | 00:06:00,625

Phoebe | Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? | 00:06:02,895 | 00:06:05,090

Phoebe | You went shopping for fur? | 00:06:15,408 | 00:06:17,968

Phoebe | And then I realized that I'm against that. | 00:06:19,112 | 00:06:21,706

Joey | Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. | 00:05:43,242 | 00:05:47,178

Joey | Hey, Annabel. | 00:06:54,714 | 00:06:55,738

Joey | I was wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee? | 00:06:56,182 | 00:07:00,084

Annabelle | You bet. | 00:07:10,930 | 00:07:12,363

Annabelle | Maybe some other time. | 00:07:14,167 | 00:07:15,395

Joey |  | 00:03:23,369 | 00:03:25,098

Joey | And hello to the rest. | 00:03:26,206 | 00:03:28,401

Joey | You can't go shopping with her. What about Rachel? | 00:03:31,177 | 00:03:34,806

Joey | Will it be a problem? | 00:03:35,748 | 00:03:36,942

Joey | You're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie. It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship. | 00:03:37,183 | 00:03:42,977

Joey | Monica, she will kill you. | 00:03:44,524 | 00:03:46,116

Joey | She will kill you like a dog in the street! | 00:03:47,827 | 00:03:50,489

Joey | So Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow. | 00:03:55,101 | 00:03:58,696

Joey | It's actually not that big a deal. | 00:03:59,372 | 00:04:01,932

Joey | It's a big deal to me. This is great. I really appreciate this. You're welcome. | 00:04:02,242 | 00:04:08,280

Joey | Bijan for men? | 00:04:23,129 | 00:04:24,357

Susan | Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. | 00:07:50,102 | 00:07:57,274

Susan |  | 00:16:49,608 | 00:16:52,441

[Scene | I was wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee? Actually, I sort of have plans. | 00:06:56,182 | 00:07:02,654

[Scene | You ready, Annabel? | 00:07:07,994 | 00:07:09,552

[Scene | You bet. | 00:07:10,930 | 00:07:12,363

[Scene | Maybe some other time. | 00:07:14,167 | 00:07:15,395

[Scene | It's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? | 00:07:26,112 | 00:07:31,849

[Scene | Bijan for men! | 00:07:32,318 | 00:07:33,910

[Scene | And this is Funny Clown. It's only for after his naps, not before, or he won't sleep. We've been through this before. We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. | 00:07:35,488 | 00:07:48,229

[Scene | Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. | 00:07:50,102 | 00:07:57,274

[Scene | This is so cute! I got that for him! | 00:07:59,345 | 00:08:02,905

[Scene | "My Mommies Love Me." | 00:08:03,216 | 00:08:04,683

[Scene | That's clever. | 00:08:08,621 | 00:08:10,145

[Scene | Oh, hi, Jul... | 00:08:12,792 | 00:08:14,487

[Scene | Hi, Jew! | 00:08:15,895 | 00:08:17,328

[Scene | Okay, sure. That'd be great. See you then. Bye. | 00:08:22,268 | 00:08:26,599

[Scene | Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"? | 00:08:27,073 | 00:08:29,098

[Scene | Yes, I did. That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz. | 00:08:34,146 | 00:08:37,941

[Scene | Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. | 00:08:46,526 | 00:08:49,290

[Scene | Ben, dinner! | 00:08:54,734 | 00:08:56,702

[Scene | Thanks, Aunt Pheebs. Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk. | 00:08:57,637 | 00:09:02,741

[Scene | I think I know how to heat breast milk. | 00:09:03,009 | 00:09:05,876

[Scene | What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk! So? Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person. | 00:09:09,649 | 00:09:21,121

[Scene | What is the big deal? | 00:09:22,828 | 00:09:24,819

[Scene | What did you just do? | 00:09:26,966 | 00:09:28,797

[Scene | Can people stop drinking the breast milk? | 00:09:30,903 | 00:09:34,304

[Scene | You won't even taste it? | 00:09:35,908 | 00:09:37,500

[Scene | Not even if you just pretend it's milk? Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. | 00:09:39,011 | 00:09:45,608

[Scene | - Where is everybody? - At the park. Where have you been? | 00:09:53,392 | 00:09:56,759

[Scene | Just out. Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me. | 00:09:57,363 | 00:10:02,864

[Scene | - Thanks for your jacket. - No problem. | 00:10:04,236 | 00:10:05,965

[Scene | You can borrow it, by the way. | 00:10:06,739 | 00:10:09,037

[Scene | Here are your keys, honey. | 00:10:10,276 | 00:10:12,107

[Scene | If you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53? | 00:10:16,115 | 00:10:19,915

[Scene | You know what probably happened? Someone stole my credit card. | 00:10:23,289 | 00:10:27,419

[Scene | And put the receipt back in your pocket? | 00:10:29,528 | 00:10:31,758

[Scene | That is an excellent, excellent question. That is excellent. | 00:10:33,532 | 00:10:38,168

[Scene | What's with you? Who did you have lunch with? - Judy. - Who? | 00:10:39,538 | 00:10:43,936

[Scene | - Julie. - What? Jody. | 00:10:44,210 | 00:10:46,775

[Scene | You were with Julie? | 00:10:48,481 | 00:10:49,778

[Scene | When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her... | 00:10:51,183 | 00:10:54,710

[Scene | ...because she was my brother's girlfriend. | 00:10:55,021 | 00:10:57,581

[Scene | And then one thing led to another... ...and before I knew it, we were... ...shopping. | 00:10:58,024 | 00:11:06,364

[Scene | Oh, my God! | 00:11:11,303 | 00:11:12,235

[Scene | Wait, we only did it once. | 00:11:14,473 | 00:11:16,304

[Scene | It didn't meant anything to me! | 00:11:18,511 | 00:11:20,069

[Scene | Rachal, I was thinking of you the whole time. | 00:11:23,649 | 00:11:26,447

[Scene | Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out. Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught! | 00:11:29,488 | 00:11:37,522

[Scene | That is not true! So you just happened to leave it in here? | 00:11:38,097 | 00:11:42,000

[Scene | Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? | 00:11:43,069 | 00:11:46,732

[Scene | Okay, I just have to know one thing. | 00:11:48,708 | 00:11:50,938

[Scene | Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now. | 00:11:54,814 | 00:12:14,891

[Scene | Hi, who's this? | 00:12:25,778 | 00:12:26,802

[Scene | Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. | 00:12:27,179 | 00:12:30,171

[Scene | Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. | 00:12:31,283 | 00:12:33,478

[Scene | Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. | 00:12:34,053 | 00:12:36,613

[Scene | No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. | 00:12:38,190 | 00:12:42,092

[Scene | How did we do? I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out. | 00:12:47,466 | 00:12:51,528

Ross |  Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk. | 00:08:57,637 | 00:09:02,741

Chandler | What did you just do? | 00:09:09,649 | 00:09:11,708

Phoebe | I licked my arm, what? | 00:09:11,984 | 00:09:13,713

Rachel | Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person. | 00:09:17,924 | 00:09:21,121

Joey | What is the big deal? | 00:09:22,828 | 00:09:24,819

Chandler | What did you just do? | 00:09:09,649 | 00:09:11,708

Phoebe | You won't even taste it? | 00:09:35,908 | 00:09:37,500

Phoebe | Not even if you just | 00:09:39,011 | 00:09:41,138

Monica | Just out. Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me. | 00:09:57,363 | 00:10:02,864

Monica | - Thanks for your jacket. - No problem. | 00:10:04,236 | 00:10:05,965

Monica | You know what probably happened? Someone stole my credit card. | 00:10:23,289 | 00:10:27,419

Monica | excellent question. That is excellent. | 00:10:33,532 | 00:10:38,168

Rachel |  | 00:11:33,859 | 00:11:37,522

Monica | Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? | 00:11:43,069 | 00:11:46,732

Monica |  | 00:03:23,369 | 00:03:25,098

Monica | - Hey, Annabel. - Hey, Joey. Did you hear about the new guy? | 00:04:30,803 | 00:04:34,798

Monica | Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls call him "The Hombre Man." | 00:04:35,108 | 00:04:39,477

Monica | Hombre? | 00:04:48,921 | 00:04:50,286

Monica | ...from young men's to the escalator is my territory. | 00:05:17,083 | 00:05:20,519

Monica | "Your territory"? | 00:05:22,221 | 00:05:24,246

Monica | Hi, Jew! | 00:08:15,895 | 00:08:17,328

Monica | Okay, sure. That'd be great. See you then. Bye. | 00:08:22,268 | 00:08:26,599

Monica | Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"? | 00:08:27,073 | 00:08:29,098

Monica | Yes, I did. That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz. | 00:08:34,146 | 00:08:37,941

Monica | Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. | 00:08:46,526 | 00:08:49,290

Monica | Ben, dinner! | 00:08:54,734 | 00:08:56,702

Monica | Thanks, Aunt Pheebs. Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk. | 00:08:57,637 | 00:09:02,741

Monica | I think I know how to heat breast milk. | 00:09:03,009 | 00:09:05,876

Monica | What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk! So? Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person. | 00:09:09,649 | 00:09:21,121

Monica | What is the big deal? | 00:09:22,828 | 00:09:24,819

Monica | What did you just do? | 00:09:26,966 | 00:09:28,797

Monica | Can people stop drinking the breast milk? | 00:09:30,903 | 00:09:34,304

Monica | You won't even taste it? | 00:09:35,908 | 00:09:37,500

Monica | Not even if you just pretend it's milk? Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. | 00:09:39,011 | 00:09:45,608

Monica | - Where is everybody? - At the park. Where have you been? | 00:09:53,392 | 00:09:56,759

Monica | Just out. Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me. | 00:09:57,363 | 00:10:02,864

Monica | - Thanks for your jacket. - No problem. | 00:10:04,236 | 00:10:05,965

Monica | You can borrow it, by the way. | 00:10:06,739 | 00:10:09,037

Monica | Here are your keys, honey. | 00:10:10,276 | 00:10:12,107

Monica | If you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53? | 00:10:16,115 | 00:10:19,915

Monica | You know what probably happened? Someone stole my credit card. | 00:10:23,289 | 00:10:27,419

Monica | And put the receipt back in your pocket? | 00:10:29,528 | 00:10:31,758

Monica | That is an excellent, excellent question. That is excellent. | 00:10:33,532 | 00:10:38,168

Monica | What's with you? Who did you have lunch with? - Judy. - Who? | 00:10:39,538 | 00:10:43,936

Monica | - Julie. - What? Jody. | 00:10:44,210 | 00:10:46,775

Monica | You were with Julie? | 00:10:48,481 | 00:10:49,778

Monica | When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her... | 00:10:51,183 | 00:10:54,710

Monica | ...because she was my brother's girlfriend. | 00:10:55,021 | 00:10:57,581

Monica | And then one thing led to another... ...and before I knew it, we were... ...shopping. | 00:10:58,024 | 00:11:06,364

Monica | Oh, my God! | 00:11:11,303 | 00:11:12,235

Monica | Wait, we only did it once. | 00:11:14,473 | 00:11:16,304

Monica | It didn't meant anything to me! | 00:11:18,511 | 00:11:20,069

Monica | Rachal, I was thinking of you the whole time. | 00:11:23,649 | 00:11:26,447

Monica | Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out. Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught! | 00:11:29,488 | 00:11:37,522

Monica | That is not true! So you just happened to leave it in here? | 00:11:38,097 | 00:11:42,000

Monica | Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? | 00:11:43,069 | 00:11:46,732

Monica | Okay, I just have to know one thing. | 00:11:48,708 | 00:11:50,938

Monica | Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now. | 00:11:54,814 | 00:12:14,891

Monica | Hi, who's this? | 00:12:25,778 | 00:12:26,802

Monica | Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. | 00:12:27,179 | 00:12:30,171

Monica | Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. | 00:12:31,283 | 00:12:33,478

Monica | Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. | 00:12:34,053 | 00:12:36,613

Monica | No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. | 00:12:38,190 | 00:12:42,092

Carol and Susan |  | 00:00:17,951 | 00:00:18,883

Phoebe |  | 00:16:49,608 | 00:16:52,441

Ross | I did not freak out. | 00:12:52,371 | 00:12:53,531

Ross |  | 00:12:53,806 | 00:12:57,003

Ross | It's gross! | 00:12:58,110 | 00:12:58,940

Carol | My breast milk is gross? | 00:12:59,979 | 00:13:01,412

Ross |  | 00:00:05,872 | 00:00:08,773

Ross | ...in 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist! | 00:00:09,009 | 00:00:11,705

Ross | Look at these. Hey, Ben. | 00:00:15,582 | 00:00:18,883

Ross | "Just do it"! | 00:00:19,119 | 00:00:20,746

Ross | Oh, my God! Was that too much pressure for him? | 00:00:22,956 | 00:00:26,415

Ross | - Is he hungry already? - I guess so. | 00:00:28,194 | 00:00:31,459

Ross | You know, it's... | 00:00:32,599 | 00:00:34,157

Ross | Something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. | 00:00:37,203 | 00:00:40,195

Ross | I gotta get one too. | 00:00:41,508 | 00:00:43,169

Ross | Hey, what are you guys doing? | 00:00:45,912 | 00:00:47,743

Ross | We're just hanging out by the spoons. | 00:00:48,081 | 00:00:50,447

Ross | Ladle? Will you guys grow up? | 00:00:51,151 | 00:00:53,946

Ross | This is the most nature beautiful thing in the world. | 00:00:54,187 | 00:00:56,951

Ross | Yeah, we know. But there's a baby sucking on it. | 00:00:57,223 | 00:01:00,192

Ross | This is my son having lunch, okay? It'll happen a lot, so get used to it. | 00:01:02,395 | 00:01:07,526

Ross | If you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it. | 00:01:08,068 | 00:01:13,298

Ross | Carol? | 00:01:16,342 | 00:01:17,138

Ross | I'm wondering, could Joey ask you a question about breast-feeding? | 00:01:20,146 | 00:01:23,775

Ross | Sure. | 00:01:26,286 | 00:01:27,218

Ross | Does it hurt? | 00:01:29,756 | 00:01:31,155

Ross | It did at first, but not anymore. | 00:01:32,459 | 00:01:34,927

Ross | Chandler? | 00:01:35,361 | 00:01:36,385

Ross | So, how often can you do it? | 00:01:39,365 | 00:01:41,333

Ross | As much as he needs. | 00:01:42,001 | 00:01:43,400

Ross | Okay, I got one, I got one. | 00:01:44,204 | 00:01:46,695

Ross | If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger? | 00:01:49,042 | 00:01:52,068

Ross | The One With the Breast Milk - Any muffins left? - Yeah, I forget which ones. You're busy, I'll get it. - Anyone else want one? - No, thanks. You're losing your apron. Let me get it. | 00:01:55,882 | 00:02:53,037

Ross | - There you go. - Thank you. | 00:02:54,107 | 00:02:56,007

Ross | What a bitch! I have a friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting... ...and he wants to abuse his discount. Anyone want to come take advantage of it? I have to take my grandmother to the vet. | 00:02:57,777 | 00:03:13,885

Ross | - I'll go with you. - Great. | 00:03:18,631 | 00:03:20,326

Ross | - Hi, honey. - Hey, sweetums. | 00:03:23,369 | 00:03:25,098

Ross | And hello to the rest. | 00:03:26,206 | 00:03:28,401

Ross | You can't go shopping with her. What about Rachel? | 00:03:31,177 | 00:03:34,806

Ross | Will it be a problem? | 00:03:35,748 | 00:03:36,942

Ross | You're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie. It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship. | 00:03:37,183 | 00:03:42,977

Ross | Monica, she will kill you. | 00:03:44,524 | 00:03:46,116

Ross | She will kill you like a dog in the street! | 00:03:47,827 | 00:03:50,489

Ross | So Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow. | 00:03:55,101 | 00:03:58,696

Ross | It's actually not that big a deal. | 00:03:59,372 | 00:04:01,932

Ross | It's a big deal to me. This is great. I really appreciate this. You're welcome. | 00:04:02,242 | 00:04:08,280

Ross | Bijan for men? | 00:04:23,129 | 00:04:24,357

Ross | Bijan for men? | 00:04:25,832 | 00:04:27,060

Ross | - Hey, Annabel. - Hey, Joey. Did you hear about the new guy? | 00:04:30,803 | 00:04:34,798

Ross | Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls call him "The Hombre Man." | 00:04:35,108 | 00:04:39,477

Ross | Hombre? | 00:04:48,921 | 00:04:50,286

Ross | What's he doing in my section? I guess he doesn't know. Well, he's gonna. | 00:04:55,128 | 00:05:01,190

Ross | I'll see you a little later, okay? | 00:05:02,302 | 00:05:04,293

Ross | Hey, how you doing? Mornin'. | 00:05:07,607 | 00:05:10,574

Ross | Listen, I know you're new... ...but it's understood that everything... | 00:05:11,477 | 00:05:16,876

Ross | ...from young men's to the escalator is my territory. | 00:05:17,083 | 00:05:20,519

Ross | "Your territory"? | 00:05:22,221 | 00:05:24,246

Ross | - Bijan for men? - No, thanks. Hombre? | 00:05:25,625 | 00:05:28,892

Ross | Yeah, all right. | 00:05:29,228 | 00:05:31,355

Ross | You were saying? | 00:05:38,137 | 00:05:39,195

Ross | Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. | 00:05:43,242 | 00:05:47,178

Ross | We shopped and we had lunch. | 00:05:48,147 | 00:05:49,705

Ross | What did I have? - You had a salad. - No wonder I don't feel full. | 00:05:50,016 | 00:05:55,116

Ross | Hi. What's up? I went shopping with Monica and I had a salad. | 00:05:56,322 | 00:06:00,625

Ross | Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? | 00:06:02,895 | 00:06:05,090

Ross | We went shopping for... For... | 00:06:06,666 | 00:06:10,627

Ross | For fur. | 00:06:11,070 | 00:06:12,833

Ross | You went shopping for fur? | 00:06:15,408 | 00:06:17,968

Ross | And then I realized that I'm against that. | 00:06:19,112 | 00:06:21,706

Ross | So then we bought some... | 00:06:23,116 | 00:06:25,243

Ross | Boobs. | 00:06:26,686 | 00:06:27,778

Ross | You bought boobs? | 00:06:33,693 | 00:06:34,591

Ross | Bras! | 00:06:37,864 | 00:06:39,388

Ross | We bought bras! | 00:06:40,266 | 00:06:41,358

Ross | We bought bras. | 00:06:42,368 | 00:06:44,529

Ross | Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... | 00:06:47,673 | 00:06:52,776

Ross | Hey, Annabel. | 00:06:54,714 | 00:06:55,738

Ross | I was wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee? Actually, I sort of have plans. | 00:06:56,182 | 00:07:02,654

Ross | You ready, Annabel? | 00:07:07,994 | 00:07:09,552

Ross | You bet. | 00:07:10,930 | 00:07:12,363

Ross | Maybe some other time. | 00:07:14,167 | 00:07:15,395

Ross | It's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? | 00:07:26,112 | 00:07:31,849

Ross | Bijan for men! | 00:07:32,318 | 00:07:33,910

Ross | And this is Funny Clown. It's only for after his naps, not before, or he won't sleep. We've been through this before. We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. | 00:07:35,488 | 00:07:48,229

Ross | Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. | 00:07:50,102 | 00:07:57,274

Ross | This is so cute! I got that for him! | 00:07:59,345 | 00:08:02,905

Ross | "My Mommies Love Me." | 00:08:03,216 | 00:08:04,683

Ross | That's clever. | 00:08:08,621 | 00:08:10,145

Ross | Oh, hi, Jul... | 00:08:12,792 | 00:08:14,487

Ross | Hi, Jew! | 00:08:15,895 | 00:08:17,328

Ross | Okay, sure. That'd be great. See you then. Bye. | 00:08:22,268 | 00:08:26,599

Ross | Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"? | 00:08:27,073 | 00:08:29,098

Ross | Yes, I did. That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz. | 00:08:34,146 | 00:08:37,941

Ross | Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. | 00:08:46,526 | 00:08:49,290

Ross | Ben, dinner! | 00:08:54,734 | 00:08:56,702

Ross | Thanks, Aunt Pheebs. Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk. | 00:08:57,637 | 00:09:02,741

Ross | I think I know how to heat breast milk. | 00:09:03,009 | 00:09:05,876

Ross | What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk! So? Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person. | 00:09:09,649 | 00:09:21,121

Ross | What is the big deal? | 00:09:22,828 | 00:09:24,819

Ross | What did you just do? | 00:09:26,966 | 00:09:28,797

Ross | Can people stop drinking the breast milk? | 00:09:30,903 | 00:09:34,304

Ross | You won't even taste it? | 00:09:35,908 | 00:09:37,500

Ross | That is an excellent, excellent question. That is excellent. | 00:10:33,532 | 00:10:38,168

Ross | What's with you? Who did you have lunch with? - Judy. - Who? | 00:10:39,538 | 00:10:43,936

Ross | - Julie. - What? Jody. | 00:10:44,210 | 00:10:46,775

Ross | You were with Julie? | 00:10:48,481 | 00:10:49,778

Ross | When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her... | 00:10:51,183 | 00:10:54,710

Ross | Oh, my God! | 00:11:11,303 | 00:11:12,235

Ross | Wait, we only did it once. | 00:11:14,473 | 00:11:16,304

Ross | It didn't meant anything to me! | 00:11:18,511 | 00:11:20,069

Ross | Rachal, I was thinking of you the whole time. | 00:11:23,649 | 00:11:26,447

Ross | Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out. Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught! | 00:11:29,488 | 00:11:37,522

Ross | That is not true! So you just happened to leave it in here? | 00:11:38,097 | 00:11:42,000

Ross | Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? | 00:11:43,069 | 00:11:46,732

Ross | Okay, I just have to know one thing. | 00:11:48,708 | 00:11:50,938

Ross | Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now. | 00:11:54,814 | 00:12:14,891

Ross | Hi, who's this? | 00:12:25,778 | 00:12:26,802

Ross | Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. | 00:12:27,179 | 00:12:30,171

Ross | Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. | 00:12:31,283 | 00:12:33,478

Ross | Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. | 00:12:34,053 | 00:12:36,613

Ross | No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. | 00:12:38,190 | 00:12:42,092

Ross | How did we do? I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out. | 00:12:47,466 | 00:12:51,528

Ross | I did not freak out. - Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk. | 00:12:52,371 | 00:12:57,003

Ross | It's gross! | 00:12:58,110 | 00:12:58,940

Ross | My breast milk is gross? | 00:12:59,979 | 00:13:01,412

Ross | This should be fun. | 00:13:03,315 | 00:13:05,249

Ross | There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults. | 00:13:07,286 | 00:13:12,918

Ross | Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids. | 00:13:13,225 | 00:13:16,456

Ross | Don't be silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal. Just taste it. | 00:13:18,764 | 00:13:22,798

Ross | That would be no. | 00:13:24,637 | 00:13:26,434

Phoebe |  It's natural. It doesn't taste bad. | 00:13:27,339 | 00:13:31,039

Ross |  | 00:00:05,872 | 00:00:08,773

Ross | ...in 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist! | 00:00:09,009 | 00:00:11,705

Ross | Look at these. Hey, Ben. | 00:00:15,582 | 00:00:18,883

Ross | "Just do it"! | 00:00:19,119 | 00:00:20,746

Ross | Oh, my God! Was that too much pressure for him? | 00:00:22,956 | 00:00:26,415

Ross | - Is he hungry already? - I guess so. | 00:00:28,194 | 00:00:31,459

Ross | You know, it's... | 00:00:32,599 | 00:00:34,157

Ross | Something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. | 00:00:37,203 | 00:00:40,195

Ross | I gotta get one too. | 00:00:41,508 | 00:00:43,169

Ross | Hey, what are you guys doing? | 00:00:45,912 | 00:00:47,743

Ross | We're just hanging out by the spoons. | 00:00:48,081 | 00:00:50,447

Ross | Ladle? Will you guys grow up? | 00:00:51,151 | 00:00:53,946

Ross | This is the most nature beautiful thing in the world. | 00:00:54,187 | 00:00:56,951

Ross | Yeah, we know. But there's a baby sucking on it. | 00:00:57,223 | 00:01:00,192

Ross | This is my son having lunch, okay? It'll happen a lot, so get used to it. | 00:01:02,395 | 00:01:07,526

Ross | If you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it. | 00:01:08,068 | 00:01:13,298

Ross | Carol? | 00:01:16,342 | 00:01:17,138

Ross | I'm wondering, could Joey ask you a question about breast-feeding? | 00:01:20,146 | 00:01:23,775

Ross | Sure. | 00:01:26,286 | 00:01:27,218

Ross | Does it hurt? | 00:01:29,756 | 00:01:31,155

Ross | It did at first, but not anymore. | 00:01:32,459 | 00:01:34,927

Ross | Chandler? | 00:01:35,361 | 00:01:36,385

Ross | So, how often can you do it? | 00:01:39,365 | 00:01:41,333

Ross | As much as he needs. | 00:01:42,001 | 00:01:43,400

Ross | Okay, I got one, I got one. | 00:01:44,204 | 00:01:46,695

Ross | If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger? | 00:01:49,042 | 00:01:52,068

Ross | The One With the Breast Milk - Any muffins left? - Yeah, I forget which ones. You're busy, I'll get it. - Anyone else want one? - No, thanks. You're losing your apron. Let me get it. | 00:01:55,882 | 00:02:53,037

Ross | - There you go. - Thank you. | 00:02:54,107 | 00:02:56,007

Ross | What a bitch! I have a friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting... ...and he wants to abuse his discount. Anyone want to come take advantage of it? I have to take my grandmother to the vet. | 00:02:57,777 | 00:03:13,885

Ross | - I'll go with you. - Great. | 00:03:18,631 | 00:03:20,326

Ross | - Hi, honey. - Hey, sweetums. | 00:03:23,369 | 00:03:25,098

Ross | And hello to the rest. | 00:03:26,206 | 00:03:28,401

Ross | You can't go shopping with her. What about Rachel? | 00:03:31,177 | 00:03:34,806

Ross | Will it be a problem? | 00:03:35,748 | 00:03:36,942

Ross | You're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie. It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship. | 00:03:37,183 | 00:03:42,977

Ross | Monica, she will kill you. | 00:03:44,524 | 00:03:46,116

Ross | She will kill you like a dog in the street! | 00:03:47,827 | 00:03:50,489

Ross | So Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow. | 00:03:55,101 | 00:03:58,696

Ross | It's actually not that big a deal. | 00:03:59,372 | 00:04:01,932

Ross | It's a big deal to me. This is great. I really appreciate this. You're welcome. | 00:04:02,242 | 00:04:08,280

Ross | Bijan for men? | 00:04:23,129 | 00:04:24,357

Ross | Bijan for men? | 00:04:25,832 | 00:04:27,060

Ross | - Hey, Annabel. - Hey, Joey. Did you hear about the new guy? | 00:04:30,803 | 00:04:34,798

Ross | Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls call him "The Hombre Man." | 00:04:35,108 | 00:04:39,477

Ross | Hombre? | 00:04:48,921 | 00:04:50,286

Ross | What's he doing in my section? I guess he doesn't know. Well, he's gonna. | 00:04:55,128 | 00:05:01,190

Ross | I'll see you a little later, okay? | 00:05:02,302 | 00:05:04,293

Ross | Hey, how you doing? Mornin'. | 00:05:07,607 | 00:05:10,574

Ross | Listen, I know you're new... ...but it's understood that everything... | 00:05:11,477 | 00:05:16,876

Ross | ...from young men's to the escalator is my territory. | 00:05:17,083 | 00:05:20,519

Ross | "Your territory"? | 00:05:22,221 | 00:05:24,246

Ross | - Bijan for men? - No, thanks. Hombre? | 00:05:25,625 | 00:05:28,892

Ross | Yeah, all right. | 00:05:29,228 | 00:05:31,355

Ross | You were saying? | 00:05:38,137 | 00:05:39,195

Ross | Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. | 00:05:43,242 | 00:05:47,178

Ross | We shopped and we had lunch. | 00:05:48,147 | 00:05:49,705

Ross | What did I have? - You had a salad. - No wonder I don't feel full. | 00:05:50,016 | 00:05:55,116

Ross | Hi. What's up? I went shopping with Monica and I had a salad. | 00:05:56,322 | 00:06:00,625

Ross | Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? | 00:06:02,895 | 00:06:05,090

Ross | We went shopping for... For... | 00:06:06,666 | 00:06:10,627

Ross | For fur. | 00:06:11,070 | 00:06:12,833

Ross | You went shopping for fur? | 00:06:15,408 | 00:06:17,968

Ross | And then I realized that I'm against that. | 00:06:19,112 | 00:06:21,706

Ross | So then we bought some... | 00:06:23,116 | 00:06:25,243

Ross | Boobs. | 00:06:26,686 | 00:06:27,778

Ross | You bought boobs? | 00:06:33,693 | 00:06:34,591

Ross | Bras! | 00:06:37,864 | 00:06:39,388

Ross | We bought bras! | 00:06:40,266 | 00:06:41,358

Ross | We bought bras. | 00:06:42,368 | 00:06:44,529

Ross | Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... | 00:06:47,673 | 00:06:52,776

Ross | Hey, Annabel. | 00:06:54,714 | 00:06:55,738

Ross | I was wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee? Actually, I sort of have plans. | 00:06:56,182 | 00:07:02,654

Ross | You ready, Annabel? | 00:07:07,994 | 00:07:09,552

Ross | You bet. | 00:07:10,930 | 00:07:12,363

Ross | Maybe some other time. | 00:07:14,167 | 00:07:15,395

Ross | It's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? | 00:07:26,112 | 00:07:31,849

Ross | Bijan for men! | 00:07:32,318 | 00:07:33,910

Ross | And this is Funny Clown. It's only for after his naps, not before, or he won't sleep. We've been through this before. We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. | 00:07:35,488 | 00:07:48,229

Ross | Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. | 00:07:50,102 | 00:07:57,274

Ross | This is so cute! I got that for him! | 00:07:59,345 | 00:08:02,905

Ross | "My Mommies Love Me." | 00:08:03,216 | 00:08:04,683

Ross | That's clever. | 00:08:08,621 | 00:08:10,145

Ross | Oh, hi, Jul... | 00:08:12,792 | 00:08:14,487

Ross | Hi, Jew! | 00:08:15,895 | 00:08:17,328

Ross | Okay, sure. That'd be great. See you then. Bye. | 00:08:22,268 | 00:08:26,599

Ross | Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"? | 00:08:27,073 | 00:08:29,098

Ross | Yes, I did. That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz. | 00:08:34,146 | 00:08:37,941

Ross | Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. | 00:08:46,526 | 00:08:49,290

Ross | Ben, dinner! | 00:08:54,734 | 00:08:56,702

Ross | Thanks, Aunt Pheebs. Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk. | 00:08:57,637 | 00:09:02,741

Ross | I think I know how to heat breast milk. | 00:09:03,009 | 00:09:05,876

Ross | What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk! So? Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person. | 00:09:09,649 | 00:09:21,121

Ross | What is the big deal? | 00:09:22,828 | 00:09:24,819

Ross | What did you just do? | 00:09:26,966 | 00:09:28,797

Ross | Can people stop drinking the breast milk? | 00:09:30,903 | 00:09:34,304

Ross | You won't even taste it? | 00:09:35,908 | 00:09:37,500

Ross | Not even if you just pretend it's milk? Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. | 00:09:39,011 | 00:09:45,608

Ross | - Where is everybody? - At the park. Where have you been? | 00:09:53,392 | 00:09:56,759

Ross | Just out. Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me. | 00:09:57,363 | 00:10:02,864

Ross | - Thanks for your jacket. - No problem. | 00:10:04,236 | 00:10:05,965

Ross | You can borrow it, by the way. | 00:10:06,739 | 00:10:09,037

Ross | Here are your keys, honey. | 00:10:10,276 | 00:10:12,107

Ross | If you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53? | 00:10:16,115 | 00:10:19,915

Ross | You know what probably happened? Someone stole my credit card. | 00:10:23,289 | 00:10:27,419

Ross | And put the receipt back in your pocket? | 00:10:29,528 | 00:10:31,758

Ross | That is an excellent, excellent question. That is excellent. | 00:10:33,532 | 00:10:38,168

Ross | What's with you? Who did you have lunch with? - Judy. - Who? | 00:10:39,538 | 00:10:43,936

Ross | - Julie. - What? Jody. | 00:10:44,210 | 00:10:46,775

Ross | You were with Julie? | 00:10:48,481 | 00:10:49,778

Ross | When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her... | 00:10:51,183 | 00:10:54,710

Ross | ...because she was my brother's girlfriend. | 00:10:55,021 | 00:10:57,581

Ross | And then one thing led to another... ...and before I knew it, we were... ...shopping. | 00:10:58,024 | 00:11:06,364

Ross | Oh, my God! | 00:11:11,303 | 00:11:12,235

Ross | Wait, we only did it once. | 00:11:14,473 | 00:11:16,304

Ross | It didn't meant anything to me! | 00:11:18,511 | 00:11:20,069

Ross | Rachal, I was thinking of you the whole time. | 00:11:23,649 | 00:11:26,447

Ross | Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out. Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught! | 00:11:29,488 | 00:11:37,522

Ross | That is not true! So you just happened to leave it in here? | 00:11:38,097 | 00:11:42,000

Ross | Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? | 00:11:43,069 | 00:11:46,732

Ross | Okay, I just have to know one thing. | 00:11:48,708 | 00:11:50,938

Ross | Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now. | 00:11:54,814 | 00:12:14,891

Ross | Hi, who's this? | 00:12:25,778 | 00:12:26,802

Ross | Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. | 00:12:27,179 | 00:12:30,171

Ross | Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. | 00:12:31,283 | 00:12:33,478

Ross | Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. | 00:12:34,053 | 00:12:36,613

Ross | No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. | 00:12:38,190 | 00:12:42,092

Ross | How did we do? I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out. | 00:12:47,466 | 00:12:51,528

Ross | I did not freak out. - Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk. | 00:12:52,371 | 00:12:57,003

Ross | It's gross! | 00:12:58,110 | 00:12:58,940

Ross | My breast milk is gross? | 00:12:59,979 | 00:13:01,412

Ross | This should be fun. | 00:13:03,315 | 00:13:05,249

Ross | There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults. | 00:13:07,286 | 00:13:12,918

Ross | Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids. | 00:13:13,225 | 00:13:16,456

Ross | Don't be silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal. Just taste it. | 00:13:18,764 | 00:13:22,798

Ross | That would be no. | 00:13:24,637 | 00:13:26,434

Ross | - Come on. - Try it. It's natural. It doesn't taste bad. Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like... Like what? Cantaloupe juice. Exactly. | 00:13:27,339 | 00:13:38,080

Ross | You've tasted it. | 00:13:45,324 | 00:13:46,814

Susan | You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. | 00:13:55,301 | 00:13:58,236

Joey |  You know? I liked being the best. | 00:15:10,075 | 00:15:15,871

Joey | Maybe I should get out of the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. | 00:15:20,452 | 00:15:26,253

Chandler |  | 00:15:46,011 | 00:15:48,002

Chandler | Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. | 00:15:49,081 | 00:15:52,812

Monica |  | 00:15:55,087 | 00:15:56,611

Monica |  | 00:15:59,959 | 00:16:01,722

Monica |  | 00:03:39,485 | 00:03:42,977

Monica | Monica, she will kill you. | 00:03:44,524 | 00:03:46,116

Monica | She will kill you like a dog in the street! | 00:03:47,827 | 00:03:50,489

Monica | So Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow. | 00:03:55,101 | 00:03:58,696

Monica | It's actually not that big a deal. | 00:03:59,372 | 00:04:01,932

Monica | It's a big deal to me. This is great. I really appreciate this. You're welcome. | 00:04:02,242 | 00:04:08,280

Monica | Bijan for men? | 00:04:23,129 | 00:04:24,357

Monica | Bijan for men? | 00:04:25,832 | 00:04:27,060

Monica | - Hey, Annabel. - Hey, Joey. Did you hear about the new guy? | 00:04:30,803 | 00:04:34,798

Monica | Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls call him "The Hombre Man." | 00:04:35,108 | 00:04:39,477

Monica | Hombre? | 00:04:48,921 | 00:04:50,286

Monica | What's he doing in my section? I guess he doesn't know. Well, he's gonna. | 00:04:55,128 | 00:05:01,190

Monica | I'll see you a little later, okay? | 00:05:02,302 | 00:05:04,293

Monica | Hey, how you doing? Mornin'. | 00:05:07,607 | 00:05:10,574

Monica | Listen, I know you're new... ...but it's understood that everything... | 00:05:11,477 | 00:05:16,876

Monica | ...from young men's to the escalator is my territory. | 00:05:17,083 | 00:05:20,519

Monica | "Your territory"? | 00:05:22,221 | 00:05:24,246

Monica | - Bijan for men? - No, thanks. Hombre? | 00:05:25,625 | 00:05:28,892

Monica | Yeah, all right. | 00:05:29,228 | 00:05:31,355

Monica | You were saying? | 00:05:38,137 | 00:05:39,195

Monica | Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. | 00:05:43,242 | 00:05:47,178

Monica | We shopped and we had lunch. | 00:05:48,147 | 00:05:49,705

Monica | What did I have? - You had a salad. - No wonder I don't feel full. | 00:05:50,016 | 00:05:55,116

Monica | Hi. What's up? I went shopping with Monica and I had a salad. | 00:05:56,322 | 00:06:00,625

Monica | Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? | 00:06:02,895 | 00:06:05,090

Monica | We went shopping for... For... | 00:06:06,666 | 00:06:10,627

Monica | For fur. | 00:06:11,070 | 00:06:12,833

Monica | You went shopping for fur? | 00:06:15,408 | 00:06:17,968

Monica | And then I realized that I'm against that. | 00:06:19,112 | 00:06:21,706

Monica | So then we bought some... | 00:06:23,116 | 00:06:25,243

Monica | Boobs. | 00:06:26,686 | 00:06:27,778

Monica | You bought boobs? | 00:06:33,693 | 00:06:34,591

Monica | Bras! | 00:06:37,864 | 00:06:39,388

Monica | We bought bras! | 00:06:40,266 | 00:06:41,358

Monica | We bought bras. | 00:06:42,368 | 00:06:44,529

Monica | Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... | 00:06:47,673 | 00:06:52,776

Monica | Hey, Annabel. | 00:06:54,714 | 00:06:55,738

Monica | I was wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee? Actually, I sort of have plans. | 00:06:56,182 | 00:07:02,654

Monica | You ready, Annabel? | 00:07:07,994 | 00:07:09,552

Monica | You bet. | 00:07:10,930 | 00:07:12,363

Monica | Maybe some other time. | 00:07:14,167 | 00:07:15,395

Monica | It's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? | 00:07:26,112 | 00:07:31,849

Monica | Bijan for men! | 00:07:32,318 | 00:07:33,910

Monica | And this is Funny Clown. It's only for after his naps, not before, or he won't sleep. We've been through this before. We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. | 00:07:35,488 | 00:07:48,229

Monica | Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. | 00:07:50,102 | 00:07:57,274

Monica | This is so cute! I got that for him! | 00:07:59,345 | 00:08:02,905

Monica | "My Mommies Love Me." | 00:08:03,216 | 00:08:04,683

Monica | That's clever. | 00:08:08,621 | 00:08:10,145

Monica | Oh, hi, Jul... | 00:08:12,792 | 00:08:14,487

Monica | Hi, Jew! | 00:08:15,895 | 00:08:17,328

Monica | Okay, sure. That'd be great. See you then. Bye. | 00:08:22,268 | 00:08:26,599

Monica | Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"? | 00:08:27,073 | 00:08:29,098

Monica | Yes, I did. That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz. | 00:08:34,146 | 00:08:37,941

Monica | Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. | 00:08:46,526 | 00:08:49,290

Monica | Ben, dinner! | 00:08:54,734 | 00:08:56,702

Monica | Thanks, Aunt Pheebs. Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk. | 00:08:57,637 | 00:09:02,741

Monica | I think I know how to heat breast milk. | 00:09:03,009 | 00:09:05,876

Monica | What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk! So? Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person. | 00:09:09,649 | 00:09:21,121

Monica | What is the big deal? | 00:09:22,828 | 00:09:24,819

Monica | What did you just do? | 00:09:26,966 | 00:09:28,797

Monica | Can people stop drinking the breast milk? | 00:09:30,903 | 00:09:34,304

Monica | You won't even taste it? | 00:09:35,908 | 00:09:37,500

Monica | Not even if you just pretend it's milk? Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. | 00:09:39,011 | 00:09:45,608

Monica | - Where is everybody? - At the park. Where have you been? | 00:09:53,392 | 00:09:56,759

Monica | Just out. Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me. | 00:09:57,363 | 00:10:02,864

Monica | - Thanks for your jacket. - No problem. | 00:10:04,236 | 00:10:05,965

Monica | You can borrow it, by the way. | 00:10:06,739 | 00:10:09,037

Monica | Here are your keys, honey. | 00:10:10,276 | 00:10:12,107

Monica | If you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53? | 00:10:16,115 | 00:10:19,915

Monica | You know what probably happened? Someone stole my credit card. | 00:10:23,289 | 00:10:27,419

Monica | And put the receipt back in your pocket? | 00:10:29,528 | 00:10:31,758

Monica | That is an excellent, excellent question. That is excellent. | 00:10:33,532 | 00:10:38,168

Monica | What's with you? Who did you have lunch with? - Judy. - Who? | 00:10:39,538 | 00:10:43,936

Monica | - Julie. - What? Jody. | 00:10:44,210 | 00:10:46,775

Monica | You were with Julie? | 00:10:48,481 | 00:10:49,778

Monica | When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her... | 00:10:51,183 | 00:10:54,710

Monica | ...because she was my brother's girlfriend. | 00:10:55,021 | 00:10:57,581

Monica | And then one thing led to another... ...and before I knew it, we were... ...shopping. | 00:10:58,024 | 00:11:06,364

Monica | Oh, my God! | 00:11:11,303 | 00:11:12,235

Monica | Wait, we only did it once. | 00:11:14,473 | 00:11:16,304

Monica | It didn't meant anything to me! | 00:11:18,511 | 00:11:20,069

Monica | Rachal, I was thinking of you the whole time. | 00:11:23,649 | 00:11:26,447

Monica | Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out. Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught! | 00:11:29,488 | 00:11:37,522

Monica | That is not true! So you just happened to leave it in here? | 00:11:38,097 | 00:11:42,000

Monica | Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? | 00:11:43,069 | 00:11:46,732

Monica | Okay, I just have to know one thing. | 00:11:48,708 | 00:11:50,938

Monica | Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now. | 00:11:54,814 | 00:12:14,891

Monica | Hi, who's this? | 00:12:25,778 | 00:12:26,802

Monica | Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. | 00:12:27,179 | 00:12:30,171

Monica | Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. | 00:12:31,283 | 00:12:33,478

Monica | Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. | 00:12:34,053 | 00:12:36,613

Monica | No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. | 00:12:38,190 | 00:12:42,092

Monica | How did we do? I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out. | 00:12:47,466 | 00:12:51,528

Monica | I did not freak out. - Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk. | 00:12:52,371 | 00:12:57,003

Monica | It's gross! | 00:12:58,110 | 00:12:58,940

Monica | My breast milk is gross? | 00:12:59,979 | 00:13:01,412

Monica | This should be fun. | 00:13:03,315 | 00:13:05,249

Monica | There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults. | 00:13:07,286 | 00:13:12,918

Monica | Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids. | 00:13:13,225 | 00:13:16,456

Monica | Don't be silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal. Just taste it. | 00:13:18,764 | 00:13:22,798

Monica | That would be no. | 00:13:24,637 | 00:13:26,434

Monica | - Come on. - Try it. It's natural. It doesn't taste bad. Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like... Like what? Cantaloupe juice. Exactly. | 00:13:27,339 | 00:13:38,080

Monica | You've tasted it. | 00:13:45,324 | 00:13:46,814

Monica | You've tasted it. | 00:13:47,526 | 00:13:48,993

Monica | Oh, you've tasted it. | 00:13:51,330 | 00:13:53,127

Monica | You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. Give me the bottle. | 00:13:55,301 | 00:14:07,576

Monica | Get me the towel. | 00:14:13,419 | 00:14:14,852

Monica | Howdy. | 00:14:39,979 | 00:14:40,968

Monica | Give me a box of juice. | 00:14:43,382 | 00:14:45,316

Monica | Well, they switched me over to Hombre. Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. | 00:14:47,753 | 00:14:53,287

Monica | Or this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it. | 00:14:54,760 | 00:14:58,355

Monica | This guy goes through two bottles a day now. | 00:14:59,031 | 00:15:01,932

Monica | What do you care? | 00:15:04,270 | 00:15:05,703

Monica | You're an actor. This is your day job. It's nothing! | 00:15:06,639 | 00:15:09,802

Monica | I know, but I was the best. You know? I liked being the best. | 00:15:10,075 | 00:15:15,871

Monica | Maybe I should get out of the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. Say you do that. Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar. | 00:15:20,452 | 00:15:31,887

Monica | Then where you gonna run? You're right. | 00:15:33,999 | 00:15:36,800

Monica | I say you show him what you're made of. Stand your ground. Show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie! | 00:15:37,036 | 00:15:45,201

Monica | - I'm gonna do it! - All right! | 00:15:46,011 | 00:15:48,002

Monica | Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. | 00:15:49,081 | 00:15:52,812

Monica | I don't know what to say. That's good because I'm not listening. I feel terrible. I really do. I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife? | 00:15:55,087 | 00:16:04,225

Monica | Say that I'm friends with her. Is that so terrible? | 00:16:07,466 | 00:16:11,425

Rachel |  | 00:16:49,608 | 00:16:52,441

Phoebe |  | 00:16:56,915 | 00:17:01,852

Monica |  | 00:11:29,488 | 00:11:33,618

Rachel |  | 00:21:41,700 | 00:21:44,430

Monica |  | 00:21:41,700 | 00:21:44,430

Store Guy |  You boys ready? | 00:18:15,327 | 00:18:20,059

Customer |  | 00:19:15,354 | 00:19:17,584

Customer | You've blinded me! I'm suing! | 00:19:18,023 | 00:19:19,991

Store Guy |  Was that too much pressure for him? | 00:00:22,956 | 00:00:26,415

Store Guy | - Is he hungry already? - I guess so. | 00:00:28,194 | 00:00:31,459

Store Guy | You know, it's... | 00:00:32,599 | 00:00:34,157

Store Guy | Something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. | 00:00:37,203 | 00:00:40,195

Store Guy | I gotta get one too. | 00:00:41,508 | 00:00:43,169

Store Guy | Hey, what are you guys doing? | 00:00:45,912 | 00:00:47,743

Store Guy | We're just hanging out by the spoons. | 00:00:48,081 | 00:00:50,447

Store Guy | Ladle? Will you guys grow up? | 00:00:51,151 | 00:00:53,946

Store Guy | This is the most nature beautiful thing in the world. | 00:00:54,187 | 00:00:56,951

Store Guy | Yeah, we know. But there's a baby sucking on it. | 00:00:57,223 | 00:01:00,192

Store Guy | This is my son having lunch, okay? It'll happen a lot, so get used to it. | 00:01:02,395 | 00:01:07,526

Store Guy | If you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it. | 00:01:08,068 | 00:01:13,298

Store Guy | Carol? | 00:01:16,342 | 00:01:17,138

Store Guy | I'm wondering, could Joey ask you a question about breast-feeding? | 00:01:20,146 | 00:01:23,775

Store Guy | Sure. | 00:01:26,286 | 00:01:27,218

Store Guy | Does it hurt? | 00:01:29,756 | 00:01:31,155

Store Guy | It did at first, but not anymore. | 00:01:32,459 | 00:01:34,927

Store Guy | Chandler? | 00:01:35,361 | 00:01:36,385

Store Guy | So, how often can you do it? | 00:01:39,365 | 00:01:41,333

Store Guy | As much as he needs. | 00:01:42,001 | 00:01:43,400

Store Guy | Okay, I got one, I got one. | 00:01:44,204 | 00:01:46,695

Store Guy | If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger? | 00:01:49,042 | 00:01:52,068

Store Guy | The One With the Breast Milk - Any muffins left? - Yeah, I forget which ones. You're busy, I'll get it. - Anyone else want one? - No, thanks. You're losing your apron. Let me get it. | 00:01:55,882 | 00:02:53,037

Store Guy | - There you go. - Thank you. | 00:02:54,107 | 00:02:56,007

Store Guy | What a bitch! I have a friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting... ...and he wants to abuse his discount. Anyone want to come take advantage of it? I have to take my grandmother to the vet. | 00:02:57,777 | 00:03:13,885

Store Guy | - I'll go with you. - Great. | 00:03:18,631 | 00:03:20,326

Store Guy | - Hi, honey. - Hey, sweetums. | 00:03:23,369 | 00:03:25,098

Store Guy | And hello to the rest. | 00:03:26,206 | 00:03:28,401

Store Guy | You can't go shopping with her. What about Rachel? | 00:03:31,177 | 00:03:34,806

Store Guy | Will it be a problem? | 00:03:35,748 | 00:03:36,942

Store Guy | You're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie. It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship. | 00:03:37,183 | 00:03:42,977

Store Guy | Monica, she will kill you. | 00:03:44,524 | 00:03:46,116

Store Guy | She will kill you like a dog in the street! | 00:03:47,827 | 00:03:50,489

Store Guy | So Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow. | 00:03:55,101 | 00:03:58,696

Store Guy | It's actually not that big a deal. | 00:03:59,372 | 00:04:01,932

Store Guy | It's a big deal to me. This is great. I really appreciate this. You're welcome. | 00:04:02,242 | 00:04:08,280

Store Guy | Bijan for men? | 00:04:23,129 | 00:04:24,357

Store Guy | Bijan for men? | 00:04:25,832 | 00:04:27,060

Store Guy | - Hey, Annabel. - Hey, Joey. Did you hear about the new guy? | 00:04:30,803 | 00:04:34,798

Store Guy | Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls call him "The Hombre Man." | 00:04:35,108 | 00:04:39,477

Store Guy | Hombre? | 00:04:48,921 | 00:04:50,286

Store Guy | What's he doing in my section? I guess he doesn't know. Well, he's gonna. | 00:04:55,128 | 00:05:01,190

Store Guy | I'll see you a little later, okay? | 00:05:02,302 | 00:05:04,293

Store Guy | Hey, how you doing? Mornin'. | 00:05:07,607 | 00:05:10,574

Store Guy | Listen, I know you're new... ...but it's understood that everything... | 00:05:11,477 | 00:05:16,876

Store Guy | ...from young men's to the escalator is my territory. | 00:05:17,083 | 00:05:20,519

Store Guy | "Your territory"? | 00:05:22,221 | 00:05:24,246

Store Guy | - Bijan for men? - No, thanks. Hombre? | 00:05:25,625 | 00:05:28,892

Store Guy | Yeah, all right. | 00:05:29,228 | 00:05:31,355

Store Guy | You were saying? | 00:05:38,137 | 00:05:39,195

Store Guy | Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. | 00:05:43,242 | 00:05:47,178

Store Guy | We shopped and we had lunch. | 00:05:48,147 | 00:05:49,705

Store Guy | What did I have? - You had a salad. - No wonder I don't feel full. | 00:05:50,016 | 00:05:55,116

Store Guy | Hi. What's up? I went shopping with Monica and I had a salad. | 00:05:56,322 | 00:06:00,625

Store Guy | Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? | 00:06:02,895 | 00:06:05,090

Store Guy | We went shopping for... For... | 00:06:06,666 | 00:06:10,627

Store Guy | For fur. | 00:06:11,070 | 00:06:12,833

Store Guy | You went shopping for fur? | 00:06:15,408 | 00:06:17,968

Store Guy | And then I realized that I'm against that. | 00:06:19,112 | 00:06:21,706

Store Guy | So then we bought some... | 00:06:23,116 | 00:06:25,243

Store Guy | Boobs. | 00:06:26,686 | 00:06:27,778

Store Guy | You bought boobs? | 00:06:33,693 | 00:06:34,591

Store Guy | Bras! | 00:06:37,864 | 00:06:39,388

Store Guy | We bought bras! | 00:06:40,266 | 00:06:41,358

Store Guy | We bought bras. | 00:06:42,368 | 00:06:44,529

Store Guy | Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... | 00:06:47,673 | 00:06:52,776

Store Guy | Hey, Annabel. | 00:06:54,714 | 00:06:55,738

Store Guy | I was wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee? Actually, I sort of have plans. | 00:06:56,182 | 00:07:02,654

Store Guy | You ready, Annabel? | 00:07:07,994 | 00:07:09,552

Store Guy | You bet. | 00:07:10,930 | 00:07:12,363

Store Guy | Maybe some other time. | 00:07:14,167 | 00:07:15,395

Store Guy | It's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? | 00:07:26,112 | 00:07:31,849

Store Guy | Bijan for men! | 00:07:32,318 | 00:07:33,910

Store Guy | And this is Funny Clown. It's only for after his naps, not before, or he won't sleep. We've been through this before. We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. | 00:07:35,488 | 00:07:48,229

Store Guy | Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. | 00:07:50,102 | 00:07:57,274

Store Guy | This is so cute! I got that for him! | 00:07:59,345 | 00:08:02,905

Store Guy | "My Mommies Love Me." | 00:08:03,216 | 00:08:04,683

Store Guy | That's clever. | 00:08:08,621 | 00:08:10,145

Store Guy | Oh, hi, Jul... | 00:08:12,792 | 00:08:14,487

Store Guy | Hi, Jew! | 00:08:15,895 | 00:08:17,328

Store Guy | Okay, sure. That'd be great. See you then. Bye. | 00:08:22,268 | 00:08:26,599

Store Guy | Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"? | 00:08:27,073 | 00:08:29,098

Store Guy | Yes, I did. That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz. | 00:08:34,146 | 00:08:37,941

Store Guy | Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. | 00:08:46,526 | 00:08:49,290

Store Guy | Ben, dinner! | 00:08:54,734 | 00:08:56,702

Store Guy | Thanks, Aunt Pheebs. Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk. | 00:08:57,637 | 00:09:02,741

Store Guy | I think I know how to heat breast milk. | 00:09:03,009 | 00:09:05,876

Store Guy | What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk! So? Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person. | 00:09:09,649 | 00:09:21,121

Store Guy | What is the big deal? | 00:09:22,828 | 00:09:24,819

Store Guy | What did you just do? | 00:09:26,966 | 00:09:28,797

Store Guy | Can people stop drinking the breast milk? | 00:09:30,903 | 00:09:34,304

Store Guy | You won't even taste it? | 00:09:35,908 | 00:09:37,500

Store Guy | Not even if you just pretend it's milk? Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. | 00:09:39,011 | 00:09:45,608

Store Guy | - Where is everybody? - At the park. Where have you been? | 00:09:53,392 | 00:09:56,759

Store Guy | Just out. Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me. | 00:09:57,363 | 00:10:02,864

Store Guy | - Thanks for your jacket. - No problem. | 00:10:04,236 | 00:10:05,965

Store Guy | You can borrow it, by the way. | 00:10:06,739 | 00:10:09,037

Store Guy | Here are your keys, honey. | 00:10:10,276 | 00:10:12,107

Store Guy | If you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53? | 00:10:16,115 | 00:10:19,915

Store Guy | You know what probably happened? Someone stole my credit card. | 00:10:23,289 | 00:10:27,419

Store Guy | And put the receipt back in your pocket? | 00:10:29,528 | 00:10:31,758

Store Guy | That is an excellent, excellent question. That is excellent. | 00:10:33,532 | 00:10:38,168

Store Guy | What's with you? Who did you have lunch with? - Judy. - Who? | 00:10:39,538 | 00:10:43,936

Store Guy | - Julie. - What? Jody. | 00:10:44,210 | 00:10:46,775

Store Guy | You were with Julie? | 00:10:48,481 | 00:10:49,778

Store Guy | When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her... | 00:10:51,183 | 00:10:54,710

Store Guy | ...because she was my brother's girlfriend. | 00:10:55,021 | 00:10:57,581

Store Guy | And then one thing led to another... ...and before I knew it, we were... ...shopping. | 00:10:58,024 | 00:11:06,364

Store Guy | Oh, my God! | 00:11:11,303 | 00:11:12,235

Store Guy | Wait, we only did it once. | 00:11:14,473 | 00:11:16,304

Store Guy | It didn't meant anything to me! | 00:11:18,511 | 00:11:20,069

Store Guy | Rachal, I was thinking of you the whole time. | 00:11:23,649 | 00:11:26,447

Store Guy | Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out. Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught! | 00:11:29,488 | 00:11:37,522

Store Guy | That is not true! So you just happened to leave it in here? | 00:11:38,097 | 00:11:42,000

Store Guy | Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? | 00:11:43,069 | 00:11:46,732

Store Guy | Okay, I just have to know one thing. | 00:11:48,708 | 00:11:50,938

Store Guy | Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now. | 00:11:54,814 | 00:12:14,891

Store Guy | Hi, who's this? | 00:12:25,778 | 00:12:26,802

Store Guy | Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. | 00:12:27,179 | 00:12:30,171

Store Guy | Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. | 00:12:31,283 | 00:12:33,478

Store Guy | Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. | 00:12:34,053 | 00:12:36,613

Store Guy | No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. | 00:12:38,190 | 00:12:42,092

Store Guy | How did we do? I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out. | 00:12:47,466 | 00:12:51,528

Store Guy | I did not freak out. - Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk. | 00:12:52,371 | 00:12:57,003

Store Guy | It's gross! | 00:12:58,110 | 00:12:58,940

Store Guy | My breast milk is gross? | 00:12:59,979 | 00:13:01,412

Store Guy | This should be fun. | 00:13:03,315 | 00:13:05,249

Store Guy | There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults. | 00:13:07,286 | 00:13:12,918

Store Guy | Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids. | 00:13:13,225 | 00:13:16,456

Store Guy | Don't be silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal. Just taste it. | 00:13:18,764 | 00:13:22,798

Store Guy | That would be no. | 00:13:24,637 | 00:13:26,434

Store Guy | - Come on. - Try it. It's natural. It doesn't taste bad. Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like... Like what? Cantaloupe juice. Exactly. | 00:13:27,339 | 00:13:38,080

Store Guy | You've tasted it. | 00:13:45,324 | 00:13:46,814

Store Guy | You've tasted it. | 00:13:47,526 | 00:13:48,993

Store Guy | Oh, you've tasted it. | 00:13:51,330 | 00:13:53,127

Store Guy | You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. Give me the bottle. | 00:13:55,301 | 00:14:07,576

Store Guy | Get me the towel. | 00:14:13,419 | 00:14:14,852

Store Guy | Howdy. | 00:14:39,979 | 00:14:40,968

Store Guy | Give me a box of juice. | 00:14:43,382 | 00:14:45,316

Store Guy | Well, they switched me over to Hombre. Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. | 00:14:47,753 | 00:14:53,287

Store Guy | Or this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it. | 00:14:54,760 | 00:14:58,355

Store Guy | This guy goes through two bottles a day now. | 00:14:59,031 | 00:15:01,932

Store Guy | What do you care? | 00:15:04,270 | 00:15:05,703

Store Guy | You're an actor. This is your day job. It's nothing! | 00:15:06,639 | 00:15:09,802

Store Guy | I know, but I was the best. You know? I liked being the best. | 00:15:10,075 | 00:15:15,871

Store Guy | Maybe I should get out of the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. Say you do that. Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar. | 00:15:20,452 | 00:15:31,887

Store Guy | Then where you gonna run? You're right. | 00:15:33,999 | 00:15:36,800

Store Guy | I say you show him what you're made of. Stand your ground. Show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie! | 00:15:37,036 | 00:15:45,201

Store Guy | - I'm gonna do it! - All right! | 00:15:46,011 | 00:15:48,002

Store Guy | Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. | 00:15:49,081 | 00:15:52,812

Store Guy | I don't know what to say. That's good because I'm not listening. I feel terrible. I really do. I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife? | 00:15:55,087 | 00:16:04,225

Store Guy | Say that I'm friends with her. Is that so terrible? | 00:16:07,466 | 00:16:11,425

Store Guy | - It's that terrible? - You don't get it! | 00:16:12,471 | 00:16:14,939

Store Guy | It's bad enough she stole the guy... | 00:16:15,207 | 00:16:16,902

Store Guy | ...who may be the person I'm supposed to be with. | 00:16:17,176 | 00:16:19,667

Store Guy | But now... | 00:16:20,145 | 00:16:21,112

Store Guy | ...she's actually... But now she's actually stealing you! | 00:16:22,548 | 00:16:27,578

Store Guy | What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. | 00:16:31,323 | 00:16:35,823

Store Guy | Because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. | 00:16:36,061 | 00:16:40,464

Store Guy | You're my... | 00:16:41,934 | 00:16:43,333

Store Guy | And we're... | 00:16:45,070 | 00:16:46,401

Store Guy | - Oh, I love you! - I love you too! | 00:16:49,608 | 00:16:52,441

Store Guy | You guys, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me. | 00:16:56,915 | 00:17:01,852

Store Guy | But I love you guys too! | 00:17:02,087 | 00:17:03,645

Store Guy | I really needed that. | 00:17:09,661 | 00:17:11,788

Store Guy | I know that right now... ...you really need to hate Julie's guts. But she didn't do anything wrong. | 00:17:13,665 | 00:17:21,502

Store Guy | She's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. | 00:17:22,174 | 00:17:29,848

Store Guy | Will you give it a chance? | 00:17:32,384 | 00:17:33,976

Store Guy | For me? | 00:17:34,887 | 00:17:36,149

Store Guy | I'd do anything for you, you know that. | 00:17:38,457 | 00:17:40,516

Store Guy | I'd do anything for you! | 00:17:41,193 | 00:17:43,661

Store Guy | Wait, wait, wait! Mornin'. | 00:17:44,596 | 00:18:05,746

Store Guy | I said, mornin'! | 00:18:08,320 | 00:18:11,118

Store Guy | I heard you. | 00:18:12,624 | 00:18:13,750

Store Guy | All right, everybody. I'm opening the doors. You boys ready? | 00:18:15,327 | 00:18:20,059

Store Guy | Ready. | 00:18:25,537 | 00:18:26,333

Store Guy | Yeah, I'm ready. You idiot! You stupid cowboy! | 00:18:27,206 | 00:19:17,584

Store Guy | You've blinded me! I'm suing! | 00:19:18,023 | 00:19:19,991

Store Guy | Oh, my God! Todd! What the hell did you do? | 00:19:20,259 | 00:19:23,820

Hombre Man |  Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught! | 00:11:29,488 | 00:11:37,522

Hombre Man | That is not true! So you just happened to leave it in here? | 00:11:38,097 | 00:11:42,000

Hombre Man | Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? | 00:11:43,069 | 00:11:46,732

Hombre Man | Okay, I just have to know one thing. | 00:11:48,708 | 00:11:50,938

Hombre Man | Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now. | 00:11:54,814 | 00:12:14,891

Hombre Man | Hi, who's this? | 00:12:25,778 | 00:12:26,802

Hombre Man | Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. | 00:12:27,179 | 00:12:30,171

Hombre Man | Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. | 00:12:31,283 | 00:12:33,478

Hombre Man | Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. | 00:12:34,053 | 00:12:36,613

Hombre Man | No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. | 00:12:38,190 | 00:12:42,092

Hombre Man | I did not freak out. - Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk. | 00:12:52,371 | 00:12:57,003

Hombre Man | It's gross! | 00:12:58,110 | 00:12:58,940

Hombre Man | My breast milk is gross? | 00:12:59,979 | 00:13:01,412

Hombre Man | It's bad enough she stole the guy... | 00:16:15,207 | 00:16:16,902

Hombre Man | ...who may be the person I'm supposed to be with. | 00:16:17,176 | 00:16:19,667

Hombre Man | But now... | 00:16:20,145 | 00:16:21,112

Hombre Man | And we're... | 00:16:45,070 | 00:16:46,401

Hombre Man | - Oh, I love you! - I love you too! | 00:16:49,608 | 00:16:52,441

Hombre Man | You guys, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me. | 00:16:56,915 | 00:17:01,852

Hombre Man | But I love you guys too! | 00:17:02,087 | 00:17:03,645

Hombre Man | Ready. | 00:18:25,537 | 00:18:26,333

Hombre Man | Yeah, I'm ready. You idiot! You stupid cowboy! | 00:18:27,206 | 00:19:17,584

Hombre Man | You've blinded me! I'm suing! | 00:19:18,023 | 00:19:19,991

Hombre Man | Oh, my God! Todd! What the hell did you do? | 00:19:20,259 | 00:19:23,820

Hombre Man | Sorry. I'm such a doofus! | 00:19:24,329 | 00:19:25,887

Hombre Man | I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. | 00:19:26,198 | 00:19:28,496

Annabelle |  | 00:00:05,872 | 00:00:08,773

Annabelle | ...in 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist! | 00:00:09,009 | 00:00:11,705

Annabelle | Look at these. Hey, Ben. | 00:00:15,582 | 00:00:18,883

Annabelle | "Just do it"! | 00:00:19,119 | 00:00:20,746

Annabelle | Oh, my God! Was that too much pressure for him? | 00:00:22,956 | 00:00:26,415

Annabelle | - Is he hungry already? - I guess so. | 00:00:28,194 | 00:00:31,459

Annabelle | You know, it's... | 00:00:32,599 | 00:00:34,157

Annabelle | Something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. | 00:00:37,203 | 00:00:40,195

Annabelle | I gotta get one too. | 00:00:41,508 | 00:00:43,169

Annabelle | Hey, what are you guys doing? | 00:00:45,912 | 00:00:47,743

Annabelle | We're just hanging out by the spoons. | 00:00:48,081 | 00:00:50,447

Annabelle | Ladle? Will you guys grow up? | 00:00:51,151 | 00:00:53,946

Annabelle | This is the most nature beautiful thing in the world. | 00:00:54,187 | 00:00:56,951

Annabelle | Yeah, we know. But there's a baby sucking on it. | 00:00:57,223 | 00:01:00,192

Annabelle | This is my son having lunch, okay? It'll happen a lot, so get used to it. | 00:01:02,395 | 00:01:07,526

Annabelle | If you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it. | 00:01:08,068 | 00:01:13,298

Annabelle | Carol? | 00:01:16,342 | 00:01:17,138

Annabelle | I'm wondering, could Joey ask you a question about breast-feeding? | 00:01:20,146 | 00:01:23,775

Annabelle | Sure. | 00:01:26,286 | 00:01:27,218

Annabelle | Does it hurt? | 00:01:29,756 | 00:01:31,155

Annabelle | It did at first, but not anymore. | 00:01:32,459 | 00:01:34,927

Annabelle | Chandler? | 00:01:35,361 | 00:01:36,385

Annabelle | So, how often can you do it? | 00:01:39,365 | 00:01:41,333

Annabelle | As much as he needs. | 00:01:42,001 | 00:01:43,400

Annabelle | Okay, I got one, I got one. | 00:01:44,204 | 00:01:46,695

Annabelle | If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger? | 00:01:49,042 | 00:01:52,068

Annabelle | The One With the Breast Milk - Any muffins left? - Yeah, I forget which ones. You're busy, I'll get it. - Anyone else want one? - No, thanks. You're losing your apron. Let me get it. | 00:01:55,882 | 00:02:53,037

Annabelle | - There you go. - Thank you. | 00:02:54,107 | 00:02:56,007

Annabelle | What a bitch! I have a friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting... ...and he wants to abuse his discount. Anyone want to come take advantage of it? I have to take my grandmother to the vet. | 00:02:57,777 | 00:03:13,885

Annabelle | - I'll go with you. - Great. | 00:03:18,631 | 00:03:20,326

Annabelle | - Hi, honey. - Hey, sweetums. | 00:03:23,369 | 00:03:25,098

Annabelle | And hello to the rest. | 00:03:26,206 | 00:03:28,401

Annabelle | You can't go shopping with her. What about Rachel? | 00:03:31,177 | 00:03:34,806

Annabelle | Will it be a problem? | 00:03:35,748 | 00:03:36,942

Annabelle | You're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie. It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship. | 00:03:37,183 | 00:03:42,977

Annabelle | Monica, she will kill you. | 00:03:44,524 | 00:03:46,116

Annabelle | She will kill you like a dog in the street! | 00:03:47,827 | 00:03:50,489

Annabelle | So Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow. | 00:03:55,101 | 00:03:58,696

Annabelle | It's actually not that big a deal. | 00:03:59,372 | 00:04:01,932

Annabelle | It's a big deal to me. This is great. I really appreciate this. You're welcome. | 00:04:02,242 | 00:04:08,280

Annabelle | Bijan for men? | 00:04:23,129 | 00:04:24,357

Annabelle | Bijan for men? | 00:04:25,832 | 00:04:27,060

Annabelle | - Hey, Annabel. - Hey, Joey. Did you hear about the new guy? | 00:04:30,803 | 00:04:34,798

Annabelle | Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls call him "The Hombre Man." | 00:04:35,108 | 00:04:39,477

Annabelle | Hombre? | 00:04:48,921 | 00:04:50,286

Annabelle | What's he doing in my section? I guess he doesn't know. Well, he's gonna. | 00:04:55,128 | 00:05:01,190

Annabelle | I'll see you a little later, okay? | 00:05:02,302 | 00:05:04,293

Annabelle | Hey, how you doing? Mornin'. | 00:05:07,607 | 00:05:10,574

Annabelle | Listen, I know you're new... ...but it's understood that everything... | 00:05:11,477 | 00:05:16,876

Annabelle | ...from young men's to the escalator is my territory. | 00:05:17,083 | 00:05:20,519

Annabelle | "Your territory"? | 00:05:22,221 | 00:05:24,246

Annabelle | - Bijan for men? - No, thanks. Hombre? | 00:05:25,625 | 00:05:28,892

Annabelle | Yeah, all right. | 00:05:29,228 | 00:05:31,355

Annabelle | You were saying? | 00:05:38,137 | 00:05:39,195

Annabelle | Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. | 00:05:43,242 | 00:05:47,178

Annabelle | We shopped and we had lunch. | 00:05:48,147 | 00:05:49,705

Annabelle | What did I have? - You had a salad. - No wonder I don't feel full. | 00:05:50,016 | 00:05:55,116

Annabelle | Hi. What's up? I went shopping with Monica and I had a salad. | 00:05:56,322 | 00:06:00,625

Annabelle | Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? | 00:06:02,895 | 00:06:05,090

Annabelle | We went shopping for... For... | 00:06:06,666 | 00:06:10,627

Annabelle | For fur. | 00:06:11,070 | 00:06:12,833

Annabelle | You went shopping for fur? | 00:06:15,408 | 00:06:17,968

Annabelle | And then I realized that I'm against that. | 00:06:19,112 | 00:06:21,706

Annabelle | So then we bought some... | 00:06:23,116 | 00:06:25,243

Annabelle | Boobs. | 00:06:26,686 | 00:06:27,778

Annabelle | You bought boobs? | 00:06:33,693 | 00:06:34,591

Annabelle | Bras! | 00:06:37,864 | 00:06:39,388

Annabelle | We bought bras! | 00:06:40,266 | 00:06:41,358

Annabelle | We bought bras. | 00:06:42,368 | 00:06:44,529

Annabelle | Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... | 00:06:47,673 | 00:06:52,776

Annabelle | Hey, Annabel. | 00:06:54,714 | 00:06:55,738

Annabelle | I was wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee? Actually, I sort of have plans. | 00:06:56,182 | 00:07:02,654

Annabelle | You ready, Annabel? | 00:07:07,994 | 00:07:09,552

Annabelle | You bet. | 00:07:10,930 | 00:07:12,363

Annabelle | Maybe some other time. | 00:07:14,167 | 00:07:15,395

Annabelle | It's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? | 00:07:26,112 | 00:07:31,849

Annabelle | Bijan for men! | 00:07:32,318 | 00:07:33,910

Annabelle | And this is Funny Clown. It's only for after his naps, not before, or he won't sleep. We've been through this before. We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. | 00:07:35,488 | 00:07:48,229

Annabelle | Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. | 00:07:50,102 | 00:07:57,274

Annabelle | This is so cute! I got that for him! | 00:07:59,345 | 00:08:02,905

Annabelle | "My Mommies Love Me." | 00:08:03,216 | 00:08:04,683

Annabelle | That's clever. | 00:08:08,621 | 00:08:10,145

Annabelle | Oh, hi, Jul... | 00:08:12,792 | 00:08:14,487

Annabelle | Hi, Jew! | 00:08:15,895 | 00:08:17,328

Annabelle | Okay, sure. That'd be great. See you then. Bye. | 00:08:22,268 | 00:08:26,599

Annabelle | Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"? | 00:08:27,073 | 00:08:29,098

Annabelle | Yes, I did. That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz. | 00:08:34,146 | 00:08:37,941

Annabelle | Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. | 00:08:46,526 | 00:08:49,290

Annabelle | Ben, dinner! | 00:08:54,734 | 00:08:56,702

Annabelle | Thanks, Aunt Pheebs. Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk. | 00:08:57,637 | 00:09:02,741

Annabelle | I think I know how to heat breast milk. | 00:09:03,009 | 00:09:05,876

Annabelle | What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk! So? Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person. | 00:09:09,649 | 00:09:21,121

Annabelle | What is the big deal? | 00:09:22,828 | 00:09:24,819

Annabelle | What did you just do? | 00:09:26,966 | 00:09:28,797

Annabelle | Can people stop drinking the breast milk? | 00:09:30,903 | 00:09:34,304

Annabelle | You won't even taste it? | 00:09:35,908 | 00:09:37,500

Annabelle | Not even if you just pretend it's milk? Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. | 00:09:39,011 | 00:09:45,608

Annabelle | - Where is everybody? - At the park. Where have you been? | 00:09:53,392 | 00:09:56,759

Annabelle | Just out. Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me. | 00:09:57,363 | 00:10:02,864

Annabelle | - Thanks for your jacket. - No problem. | 00:10:04,236 | 00:10:05,965

Annabelle | You can borrow it, by the way. | 00:10:06,739 | 00:10:09,037

Annabelle | Here are your keys, honey. | 00:10:10,276 | 00:10:12,107

Annabelle | If you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53? | 00:10:16,115 | 00:10:19,915

Annabelle | You know what probably happened? Someone stole my credit card. | 00:10:23,289 | 00:10:27,419

Annabelle | And put the receipt back in your pocket? | 00:10:29,528 | 00:10:31,758

Annabelle | That is an excellent, excellent question. That is excellent. | 00:10:33,532 | 00:10:38,168

Annabelle | What's with you? Who did you have lunch with? - Judy. - Who? | 00:10:39,538 | 00:10:43,936

Annabelle | - Julie. - What? Jody. | 00:10:44,210 | 00:10:46,775

Annabelle | You were with Julie? | 00:10:48,481 | 00:10:49,778

Annabelle | When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her... | 00:10:51,183 | 00:10:54,710

Annabelle | ...because she was my brother's girlfriend. | 00:10:55,021 | 00:10:57,581

Annabelle | And then one thing led to another... ...and before I knew it, we were... ...shopping. | 00:10:58,024 | 00:11:06,364

Annabelle | Oh, my God! | 00:11:11,303 | 00:11:12,235

Annabelle | Wait, we only did it once. | 00:11:14,473 | 00:11:16,304

Annabelle | It didn't meant anything to me! | 00:11:18,511 | 00:11:20,069

Annabelle | Rachal, I was thinking of you the whole time. | 00:11:23,649 | 00:11:26,447

Annabelle | Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out. Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught! | 00:11:29,488 | 00:11:37,522

Annabelle | That is not true! So you just happened to leave it in here? | 00:11:38,097 | 00:11:42,000

Annabelle | Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? | 00:11:43,069 | 00:11:46,732

Annabelle | Okay, I just have to know one thing. | 00:11:48,708 | 00:11:50,938

Annabelle | Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now. | 00:11:54,814 | 00:12:14,891

Annabelle | Hi, who's this? | 00:12:25,778 | 00:12:26,802

Annabelle | Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. | 00:12:27,179 | 00:12:30,171

Annabelle | Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. | 00:12:31,283 | 00:12:33,478

Annabelle | Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. | 00:12:34,053 | 00:12:36,613

Annabelle | No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. | 00:12:38,190 | 00:12:42,092

Annabelle | How did we do? I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out. | 00:12:47,466 | 00:12:51,528

Annabelle | I did not freak out. - Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk. | 00:12:52,371 | 00:12:57,003

Annabelle | It's gross! | 00:12:58,110 | 00:12:58,940

Annabelle | My breast milk is gross? | 00:12:59,979 | 00:13:01,412

Annabelle | This should be fun. | 00:13:03,315 | 00:13:05,249

Annabelle | There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults. | 00:13:07,286 | 00:13:12,918

Annabelle | Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids. | 00:13:13,225 | 00:13:16,456

Annabelle | Don't be silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal. Just taste it. | 00:13:18,764 | 00:13:22,798

Annabelle | That would be no. | 00:13:24,637 | 00:13:26,434

Annabelle | - Come on. - Try it. It's natural. It doesn't taste bad. Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like... Like what? Cantaloupe juice. Exactly. | 00:13:27,339 | 00:13:38,080

Annabelle | You've tasted it. | 00:13:45,324 | 00:13:46,814

Annabelle | You've tasted it. | 00:13:47,526 | 00:13:48,993

Annabelle | Oh, you've tasted it. | 00:13:51,330 | 00:13:53,127

Annabelle | You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. Give me the bottle. | 00:13:55,301 | 00:14:07,576

Annabelle | Get me the towel. | 00:14:13,419 | 00:14:14,852

Annabelle | Howdy. | 00:14:39,979 | 00:14:40,968

Annabelle | Give me a box of juice. | 00:14:43,382 | 00:14:45,316

Annabelle | Well, they switched me over to Hombre. Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. | 00:14:47,753 | 00:14:53,287

Annabelle | Or this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it. | 00:14:54,760 | 00:14:58,355

Annabelle | This guy goes through two bottles a day now. | 00:14:59,031 | 00:15:01,932

Annabelle | What do you care? | 00:15:04,270 | 00:15:05,703

Annabelle | You're an actor. This is your day job. It's nothing! | 00:15:06,639 | 00:15:09,802

Annabelle | I know, but I was the best. You know? I liked being the best. | 00:15:10,075 | 00:15:15,871

Annabelle | Maybe I should get out of the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. Say you do that. Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar. | 00:15:20,452 | 00:15:31,887

Annabelle | Then where you gonna run? You're right. | 00:15:33,999 | 00:15:36,800

Annabelle | I say you show him what you're made of. Stand your ground. Show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie! | 00:15:37,036 | 00:15:45,201

Annabelle | - I'm gonna do it! - All right! | 00:15:46,011 | 00:15:48,002

Annabelle | Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. | 00:15:49,081 | 00:15:52,812

Annabelle | I don't know what to say. That's good because I'm not listening. I feel terrible. I really do. I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife? | 00:15:55,087 | 00:16:04,225

Annabelle | Say that I'm friends with her. Is that so terrible? | 00:16:07,466 | 00:16:11,425

Annabelle | - It's that terrible? - You don't get it! | 00:16:12,471 | 00:16:14,939

Annabelle | It's bad enough she stole the guy... | 00:16:15,207 | 00:16:16,902

Annabelle | ...who may be the person I'm supposed to be with. | 00:16:17,176 | 00:16:19,667

Annabelle | But now... | 00:16:20,145 | 00:16:21,112

Annabelle | ...she's actually... But now she's actually stealing you! | 00:16:22,548 | 00:16:27,578

Annabelle | What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. | 00:16:31,323 | 00:16:35,823

Annabelle | Because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. | 00:16:36,061 | 00:16:40,464

Annabelle | You're my... | 00:16:41,934 | 00:16:43,333

Annabelle | And we're... | 00:16:45,070 | 00:16:46,401

Annabelle | - Oh, I love you! - I love you too! | 00:16:49,608 | 00:16:52,441

Annabelle | You guys, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me. | 00:16:56,915 | 00:17:01,852

Annabelle | But I love you guys too! | 00:17:02,087 | 00:17:03,645

Annabelle | I really needed that. | 00:17:09,661 | 00:17:11,788

Annabelle | I know that right now... ...you really need to hate Julie's guts. But she didn't do anything wrong. | 00:17:13,665 | 00:17:21,502

Annabelle | She's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. | 00:17:22,174 | 00:17:29,848

Annabelle | Will you give it a chance? | 00:17:32,384 | 00:17:33,976

Annabelle | For me? | 00:17:34,887 | 00:17:36,149

Annabelle | I'd do anything for you, you know that. | 00:17:38,457 | 00:17:40,516

Annabelle | I'd do anything for you! | 00:17:41,193 | 00:17:43,661

Annabelle | Wait, wait, wait! Mornin'. | 00:17:44,596 | 00:18:05,746

Annabelle | I said, mornin'! | 00:18:08,320 | 00:18:11,118

Annabelle | I heard you. | 00:18:12,624 | 00:18:13,750

Annabelle | All right, everybody. I'm opening the doors. You boys ready? | 00:18:15,327 | 00:18:20,059

Annabelle | Ready. | 00:18:25,537 | 00:18:26,333

Annabelle | Yeah, I'm ready. You idiot! You stupid cowboy! | 00:18:27,206 | 00:19:17,584

Annabelle | You've blinded me! I'm suing! | 00:19:18,023 | 00:19:19,991

Annabelle | Oh, my God! Todd! What the hell did you do? | 00:19:20,259 | 00:19:23,820

Annabelle | Sorry. I'm such a doofus! | 00:19:24,329 | 00:19:25,887

Annabelle | I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. | 00:19:26,198 | 00:19:28,496

Annabelle | My God, what happened? | 00:19:29,735 | 00:19:31,362

Joey | These new kids, they never last. | 00:19:32,437 | 00:19:34,803

Joey | Sooner or later they all... | 00:19:35,073 | 00:19:37,473

Joey | ...stop lasting. | 00:19:38,177 | 00:19:39,872

Joey | What do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now? | 00:19:40,612 | 00:19:44,070

Julie |  | 00:12:31,283 | 00:12:33,478

Julie | Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. | 00:12:34,053 | 00:12:36,613

Julie | No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. | 00:12:38,190 | 00:12:42,092

Julie | How did we do? I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out. | 00:12:47,466 | 00:12:51,528

Julie | I did not freak out. - Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk. | 00:12:52,371 | 00:12:57,003

Julie | It's gross! | 00:12:58,110 | 00:12:58,940

Julie | My breast milk is gross? | 00:12:59,979 | 00:13:01,412

Julie | This should be fun. | 00:13:03,315 | 00:13:05,249

Julie | There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults. | 00:13:07,286 | 00:13:12,918

Julie | Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids. | 00:13:13,225 | 00:13:16,456

Julie | Don't be silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal. Just taste it. | 00:13:18,764 | 00:13:22,798

Julie | That would be no. | 00:13:24,637 | 00:13:26,434

Julie | - Come on. - Try it. It's natural. It doesn't taste bad. Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like... Like what? Cantaloupe juice. Exactly. | 00:13:27,339 | 00:13:38,080

Julie | You've tasted it. | 00:13:45,324 | 00:13:46,814

Julie | You've tasted it. | 00:13:47,526 | 00:13:48,993

Julie | Oh, you've tasted it. | 00:13:51,330 | 00:13:53,127

Julie | You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. Give me the bottle. | 00:13:55,301 | 00:14:07,576

Julie | Get me the towel. | 00:14:13,419 | 00:14:14,852

Julie | Howdy. | 00:14:39,979 | 00:14:40,968

Julie | Give me a box of juice. | 00:14:43,382 | 00:14:45,316

Julie | Well, they switched me over to Hombre. Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. | 00:14:47,753 | 00:14:53,287

Julie | Or this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it. | 00:14:54,760 | 00:14:58,355

Julie | This guy goes through two bottles a day now. | 00:14:59,031 | 00:15:01,932

Julie | What do you care? | 00:15:04,270 | 00:15:05,703

Julie | You're an actor. This is your day job. It's nothing! | 00:15:06,639 | 00:15:09,802

Julie | I know, but I was the best. You know? I liked being the best. | 00:15:10,075 | 00:15:15,871

Julie | Maybe I should get out of the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. Say you do that. Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar. | 00:15:20,452 | 00:15:31,887

Julie | Then where you gonna run? You're right. | 00:15:33,999 | 00:15:36,800

Julie | I say you show him what you're made of. Stand your ground. Show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie! | 00:15:37,036 | 00:15:45,201

Julie | - I'm gonna do it! - All right! | 00:15:46,011 | 00:15:48,002

Julie | Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. | 00:15:49,081 | 00:15:52,812

Julie | I don't know what to say. That's good because I'm not listening. I feel terrible. I really do. I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife? | 00:15:55,087 | 00:16:04,225

Julie | Say that I'm friends with her. Is that so terrible? | 00:16:07,466 | 00:16:11,425

Julie | - It's that terrible? - You don't get it! | 00:16:12,471 | 00:16:14,939

Julie | It's bad enough she stole the guy... | 00:16:15,207 | 00:16:16,902

Julie | ...who may be the person I'm supposed to be with. | 00:16:17,176 | 00:16:19,667

Julie | But now... | 00:16:20,145 | 00:16:21,112

Julie | ...she's actually... But now she's actually stealing you! | 00:16:22,548 | 00:16:27,578

Julie | What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. | 00:16:31,323 | 00:16:35,823

Julie | Because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. | 00:16:36,061 | 00:16:40,464

Julie | You're my... | 00:16:41,934 | 00:16:43,333

Julie | And we're... | 00:16:45,070 | 00:16:46,401

Julie | - Oh, I love you! - I love you too! | 00:16:49,608 | 00:16:52,441

Julie | You guys, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me. | 00:16:56,915 | 00:17:01,852

Julie | But I love you guys too! | 00:17:02,087 | 00:17:03,645

Julie | I really needed that. | 00:17:09,661 | 00:17:11,788

Julie | I know that right now... ...you really need to hate Julie's guts. But she didn't do anything wrong. | 00:17:13,665 | 00:17:21,502

Julie | She's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. | 00:17:22,174 | 00:17:29,848

Julie | Will you give it a chance? | 00:17:32,384 | 00:17:33,976

Julie | For me? | 00:17:34,887 | 00:17:36,149

Julie | I'd do anything for you, you know that. | 00:17:38,457 | 00:17:40,516

Julie | I'd do anything for you! | 00:17:41,193 | 00:17:43,661

Julie | Wait, wait, wait! Mornin'. | 00:17:44,596 | 00:18:05,746

Julie | I said, mornin'! | 00:18:08,320 | 00:18:11,118

Julie | I heard you. | 00:18:12,624 | 00:18:13,750

Julie | All right, everybody. I'm opening the doors. You boys ready? | 00:18:15,327 | 00:18:20,059

Julie | Ready. | 00:18:25,537 | 00:18:26,333

Julie | Yeah, I'm ready. You idiot! You stupid cowboy! | 00:18:27,206 | 00:19:17,584

Julie | You've blinded me! I'm suing! | 00:19:18,023 | 00:19:19,991

Julie | Oh, my God! Todd! What the hell did you do? | 00:19:20,259 | 00:19:23,820

Julie | Sorry. I'm such a doofus! | 00:19:24,329 | 00:19:25,887

Julie | I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. | 00:19:26,198 | 00:19:28,496

Julie | My God, what happened? | 00:19:29,735 | 00:19:31,362

Julie | These new kids, they never last. | 00:19:32,437 | 00:19:34,803

Julie | Sooner or later they all... | 00:19:35,073 | 00:19:37,473

Julie | ...stop lasting. | 00:19:38,177 | 00:19:39,872

Julie | What do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now? Sure. I just thought we should hang out. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us. I know. | 00:19:40,612 | 00:20:15,302

Julie | I probably shouldn't even tell you this... ...but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you. | 00:20:16,048 | 00:20:22,612

Rachel | Well, you're not totally paranoid. | 00:20:49,781 | 00:20:51,544

Rachel | Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it. | 00:21:41,700 | 00:21:44,430

Julie | I'd love it too. | 00:21:44,703 | 00:21:46,398

Julie | Shoot, I gotta go. - So I'll talk to you later. - All right, Julie. | 00:21:47,472 | 00:21:51,909

Ross |  | 00:00:05,872 | 00:00:08,773

Ross | ...in 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist! | 00:00:09,009 | 00:00:11,705

Ross | Look at these. Hey, Ben. | 00:00:15,582 | 00:00:18,883

Ross | "Just do it"! | 00:00:19,119 | 00:00:20,746

Ross | Oh, my God! Was that too much pressure for him? | 00:00:22,956 | 00:00:26,415

Ross | - Is he hungry already? - I guess so. | 00:00:28,194 | 00:00:31,459

Ross | You know, it's... | 00:00:32,599 | 00:00:34,157

Ross | Something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. | 00:00:37,203 | 00:00:40,195

Ross | I gotta get one too. | 00:00:41,508 | 00:00:43,169

Ross | Hey, what are you guys doing? | 00:00:45,912 | 00:00:47,743

Ross | We're just hanging out by the spoons. | 00:00:48,081 | 00:00:50,447

Ross | Ladle? Will you guys grow up? | 00:00:51,151 | 00:00:53,946

Ross | This is the most nature beautiful thing in the world. | 00:00:54,187 | 00:00:56,951

Ross | Yeah, we know. But there's a baby sucking on it. | 00:00:57,223 | 00:01:00,192

Ross | This is my son having lunch, okay? It'll happen a lot, so get used to it. | 00:01:02,395 | 00:01:07,526

Ross | If you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it. | 00:01:08,068 | 00:01:13,298

Ross | Carol? | 00:01:16,342 | 00:01:17,138

Ross | I'm wondering, could Joey ask you a question about breast-feeding? | 00:01:20,146 | 00:01:23,775

Ross | Sure. | 00:01:26,286 | 00:01:27,218

Ross | Does it hurt? | 00:01:29,756 | 00:01:31,155

Ross | It did at first, but not anymore. | 00:01:32,459 | 00:01:34,927

Ross | Chandler? | 00:01:35,361 | 00:01:36,385

Ross | So, how often can you do it? | 00:01:39,365 | 00:01:41,333

Ross | As much as he needs. | 00:01:42,001 | 00:01:43,400

Ross | Okay, I got one, I got one. | 00:01:44,204 | 00:01:46,695

Ross | If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger? | 00:01:49,042 | 00:01:52,068

Ross | The One With the Breast Milk - Any muffins left? - Yeah, I forget which ones. You're busy, I'll get it. - Anyone else want one? - No, thanks. You're losing your apron. Let me get it. | 00:01:55,882 | 00:02:53,037

Ross | - There you go. - Thank you. | 00:02:54,107 | 00:02:56,007

Ross | What a bitch! I have a friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting... ...and he wants to abuse his discount. Anyone want to come take advantage of it? I have to take my grandmother to the vet. | 00:02:57,777 | 00:03:13,885

Ross | - I'll go with you. - Great. | 00:03:18,631 | 00:03:20,326

Ross | - Hi, honey. - Hey, sweetums. | 00:03:23,369 | 00:03:25,098

Ross | And hello to the rest. | 00:03:26,206 | 00:03:28,401

Ross | You can't go shopping with her. What about Rachel? | 00:03:31,177 | 00:03:34,806

Ross | Will it be a problem? | 00:03:35,748 | 00:03:36,942

Ross | You're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie. It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship. | 00:03:37,183 | 00:03:42,977

Ross | Monica, she will kill you. | 00:03:44,524 | 00:03:46,116

Ross | She will kill you like a dog in the street! | 00:03:47,827 | 00:03:50,489

Ross | So Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow. | 00:03:55,101 | 00:03:58,696

Ross | It's actually not that big a deal. | 00:03:59,372 | 00:04:01,932

Ross | It's a big deal to me. This is great. I really appreciate this. You're welcome. | 00:04:02,242 | 00:04:08,280

Ross | Bijan for men? | 00:04:23,129 | 00:04:24,357

Ross | Bijan for men? | 00:04:25,832 | 00:04:27,060

Ross | - Hey, Annabel. - Hey, Joey. Did you hear about the new guy? | 00:04:30,803 | 00:04:34,798

Ross | Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls call him "The Hombre Man." | 00:04:35,108 | 00:04:39,477

Ross | Hombre? | 00:04:48,921 | 00:04:50,286

Ross | What's he doing in my section? I guess he doesn't know. Well, he's gonna. | 00:04:55,128 | 00:05:01,190

Ross | I'll see you a little later, okay? | 00:05:02,302 | 00:05:04,293

Ross | Hey, how you doing? Mornin'. | 00:05:07,607 | 00:05:10,574

Ross | Listen, I know you're new... ...but it's understood that everything... | 00:05:11,477 | 00:05:16,876

Ross | ...from young men's to the escalator is my territory. | 00:05:17,083 | 00:05:20,519

Ross | "Your territory"? | 00:05:22,221 | 00:05:24,246

Ross | - Bijan for men? - No, thanks. Hombre? | 00:05:25,625 | 00:05:28,892

Ross | Yeah, all right. | 00:05:29,228 | 00:05:31,355

Ross | You were saying? | 00:05:38,137 | 00:05:39,195

Ross | Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. | 00:05:43,242 | 00:05:47,178

Ross | We shopped and we had lunch. | 00:05:48,147 | 00:05:49,705

Ross | What did I have? - You had a salad. - No wonder I don't feel full. | 00:05:50,016 | 00:05:55,116

Ross | Hi. What's up? I went shopping with Monica and I had a salad. | 00:05:56,322 | 00:06:00,625

Ross | Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? | 00:06:02,895 | 00:06:05,090

Ross | We went shopping for... For... | 00:06:06,666 | 00:06:10,627

Ross | For fur. | 00:06:11,070 | 00:06:12,833

Ross | You went shopping for fur? | 00:06:15,408 | 00:06:17,968

Ross | And then I realized that I'm against that. | 00:06:19,112 | 00:06:21,706

Ross | So then we bought some... | 00:06:23,116 | 00:06:25,243

Ross | Boobs. | 00:06:26,686 | 00:06:27,778

Ross | You bought boobs? | 00:06:33,693 | 00:06:34,591

Ross | Bras! | 00:06:37,864 | 00:06:39,388

Ross | We bought bras! | 00:06:40,266 | 00:06:41,358

Ross | We bought bras. | 00:06:42,368 | 00:06:44,529

Ross | Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... | 00:06:47,673 | 00:06:52,776

Ross | Hey, Annabel. | 00:06:54,714 | 00:06:55,738

Ross | I was wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee? Actually, I sort of have plans. | 00:06:56,182 | 00:07:02,654

Ross | You ready, Annabel? | 00:07:07,994 | 00:07:09,552

Ross | You bet. | 00:07:10,930 | 00:07:12,363

Ross | Maybe some other time. | 00:07:14,167 | 00:07:15,395

Ross | It's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? | 00:07:26,112 | 00:07:31,849

Ross | Bijan for men! | 00:07:32,318 | 00:07:33,910

Ross | And this is Funny Clown. It's only for after his naps, not before, or he won't sleep. We've been through this before. We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. | 00:07:35,488 | 00:07:48,229

Ross | Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. | 00:07:50,102 | 00:07:57,274

Ross | This is so cute! I got that for him! | 00:07:59,345 | 00:08:02,905

Ross | "My Mommies Love Me." | 00:08:03,216 | 00:08:04,683

Ross | That's clever. | 00:08:08,621 | 00:08:10,145

Ross | Oh, hi, Jul... | 00:08:12,792 | 00:08:14,487

Ross | Hi, Jew! | 00:08:15,895 | 00:08:17,328

Ross | Okay, sure. That'd be great. See you then. Bye. | 00:08:22,268 | 00:08:26,599

Ross | Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"? | 00:08:27,073 | 00:08:29,098

Ross | Yes, I did. That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz. | 00:08:34,146 | 00:08:37,941

Ross | Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. | 00:08:46,526 | 00:08:49,290

Ross | Ben, dinner! | 00:08:54,734 | 00:08:56,702

Ross | Thanks, Aunt Pheebs. Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk. | 00:08:57,637 | 00:09:02,741

Ross | I think I know how to heat breast milk. | 00:09:03,009 | 00:09:05,876

Ross | What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk! So? Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person. | 00:09:09,649 | 00:09:21,121

Ross | What is the big deal? | 00:09:22,828 | 00:09:24,819

Ross | What did you just do? | 00:09:26,966 | 00:09:28,797

Ross | Can people stop drinking the breast milk? | 00:09:30,903 | 00:09:34,304

Ross | You won't even taste it? | 00:09:35,908 | 00:09:37,500

Ross | Not even if you just pretend it's milk? Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. | 00:09:39,011 | 00:09:45,608

Ross | - Where is everybody? - At the park. Where have you been? | 00:09:53,392 | 00:09:56,759

Ross | Just out. Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me. | 00:09:57,363 | 00:10:02,864

Ross | - Thanks for your jacket. - No problem. | 00:10:04,236 | 00:10:05,965

Ross | You can borrow it, by the way. | 00:10:06,739 | 00:10:09,037

Ross | Here are your keys, honey. | 00:10:10,276 | 00:10:12,107

Ross | If you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53? | 00:10:16,115 | 00:10:19,915

Ross | You know what probably happened? Someone stole my credit card. | 00:10:23,289 | 00:10:27,419

Ross | And put the receipt back in your pocket? | 00:10:29,528 | 00:10:31,758

Ross | That is an excellent, excellent question. That is excellent. | 00:10:33,532 | 00:10:38,168

Ross | What's with you? Who did you have lunch with? - Judy. - Who? | 00:10:39,538 | 00:10:43,936

Ross | - Julie. - What? Jody. | 00:10:44,210 | 00:10:46,775

Ross | You were with Julie? | 00:10:48,481 | 00:10:49,778

Ross | When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her... | 00:10:51,183 | 00:10:54,710

Ross | ...because she was my brother's girlfriend. | 00:10:55,021 | 00:10:57,581

Ross | And then one thing led to another... ...and before I knew it, we were... ...shopping. | 00:10:58,024 | 00:11:06,364

Ross | Oh, my God! | 00:11:11,303 | 00:11:12,235

Ross | Wait, we only did it once. | 00:11:14,473 | 00:11:16,304

Ross | It didn't meant anything to me! | 00:11:18,511 | 00:11:20,069

Ross | Rachal, I was thinking of you the whole time. | 00:11:23,649 | 00:11:26,447

Ross | Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out. Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught! | 00:11:29,488 | 00:11:37,522

Ross | That is not true! So you just happened to leave it in here? | 00:11:38,097 | 00:11:42,000

Ross | Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? | 00:11:43,069 | 00:11:46,732

Ross | Okay, I just have to know one thing. | 00:11:48,708 | 00:11:50,938

Ross | Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now. | 00:11:54,814 | 00:12:14,891

Ross | Hi, who's this? | 00:12:25,778 | 00:12:26,802

Ross | Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. | 00:12:27,179 | 00:12:30,171

Ross | Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. | 00:12:31,283 | 00:12:33,478

Ross | Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. | 00:12:34,053 | 00:12:36,613

Ross | No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. | 00:12:38,190 | 00:12:42,092

Ross | How did we do? I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out. | 00:12:47,466 | 00:12:51,528

Ross | I did not freak out. - Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk. | 00:12:52,371 | 00:12:57,003

Ross | It's gross! | 00:12:58,110 | 00:12:58,940

Ross | My breast milk is gross? | 00:12:59,979 | 00:13:01,412

Ross | This should be fun. | 00:13:03,315 | 00:13:05,249

Ross | There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults. | 00:13:07,286 | 00:13:12,918

Ross | Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids. | 00:13:13,225 | 00:13:16,456

Ross | Don't be silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal. Just taste it. | 00:13:18,764 | 00:13:22,798

Ross | That would be no. | 00:13:24,637 | 00:13:26,434

Ross | - Come on. - Try it. It's natural. It doesn't taste bad. Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like... Like what? Cantaloupe juice. Exactly. | 00:13:27,339 | 00:13:38,080

Ross | You've tasted it. | 00:13:45,324 | 00:13:46,814

Ross | You've tasted it. | 00:13:47,526 | 00:13:48,993

Ross | Oh, you've tasted it. | 00:13:51,330 | 00:13:53,127

Ross | You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. Give me the bottle. | 00:13:55,301 | 00:14:07,576

Ross | Get me the towel. | 00:14:13,419 | 00:14:14,852

Ross | Howdy. | 00:14:39,979 | 00:14:40,968

Ross | Give me a box of juice. | 00:14:43,382 | 00:14:45,316

Ross | Well, they switched me over to Hombre. Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. | 00:14:47,753 | 00:14:53,287

Ross | Or this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it. | 00:14:54,760 | 00:14:58,355

Ross | This guy goes through two bottles a day now. | 00:14:59,031 | 00:15:01,932

Ross | What do you care? | 00:15:04,270 | 00:15:05,703

Ross | You're an actor. This is your day job. It's nothing! | 00:15:06,639 | 00:15:09,802

Ross | I know, but I was the best. You know? I liked being the best. | 00:15:10,075 | 00:15:15,871

Ross | Maybe I should get out of the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. Say you do that. Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar. | 00:15:20,452 | 00:15:31,887

Ross | Then where you gonna run? You're right. | 00:15:33,999 | 00:15:36,800

Ross | I say you show him what you're made of. Stand your ground. Show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie! | 00:15:37,036 | 00:15:45,201

Ross | - I'm gonna do it! - All right! | 00:15:46,011 | 00:15:48,002

Ross | Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. | 00:15:49,081 | 00:15:52,812

Ross | I don't know what to say. That's good because I'm not listening. I feel terrible. I really do. I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife? | 00:15:55,087 | 00:16:04,225

Ross | Say that I'm friends with her. Is that so terrible? | 00:16:07,466 | 00:16:11,425

Ross | - It's that terrible? - You don't get it! | 00:16:12,471 | 00:16:14,939

Ross | It's bad enough she stole the guy... | 00:16:15,207 | 00:16:16,902

Ross | ...who may be the person I'm supposed to be with. | 00:16:17,176 | 00:16:19,667

Ross | But now... | 00:16:20,145 | 00:16:21,112

Ross | ...she's actually... But now she's actually stealing you! | 00:16:22,548 | 00:16:27,578

Ross | What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. | 00:16:31,323 | 00:16:35,823

Ross | Because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. | 00:16:36,061 | 00:16:40,464

Ross | You're my... | 00:16:41,934 | 00:16:43,333

Ross | And we're... | 00:16:45,070 | 00:16:46,401

Ross | - Oh, I love you! - I love you too! | 00:16:49,608 | 00:16:52,441

Ross | You guys, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me. | 00:16:56,915 | 00:17:01,852

Ross | But I love you guys too! | 00:17:02,087 | 00:17:03,645

Ross | I really needed that. | 00:17:09,661 | 00:17:11,788

Ross | I know that right now... ...you really need to hate Julie's guts. But she didn't do anything wrong. | 00:17:13,665 | 00:17:21,502

Ross | She's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. | 00:17:22,174 | 00:17:29,848

Ross | Will you give it a chance? | 00:17:32,384 | 00:17:33,976

Ross | For me? | 00:17:34,887 | 00:17:36,149

Ross | I'd do anything for you, you know that. | 00:17:38,457 | 00:17:40,516

Ross | I'd do anything for you! | 00:17:41,193 | 00:17:43,661

Ross | Wait, wait, wait! Mornin'. | 00:17:44,596 | 00:18:05,746

Ross | I said, mornin'! | 00:18:08,320 | 00:18:11,118

Ross | I heard you. | 00:18:12,624 | 00:18:13,750

Ross | All right, everybody. I'm opening the doors. You boys ready? | 00:18:15,327 | 00:18:20,059

Ross | Ready. | 00:18:25,537 | 00:18:26,333

Ross | Yeah, I'm ready. You idiot! You stupid cowboy! | 00:18:27,206 | 00:19:17,584

Ross | You've blinded me! I'm suing! | 00:19:18,023 | 00:19:19,991

Ross | Oh, my God! Todd! What the hell did you do? | 00:19:20,259 | 00:19:23,820

Ross | Sorry. I'm such a doofus! | 00:19:24,329 | 00:19:25,887

Ross | I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. | 00:19:26,198 | 00:19:28,496

Ross | My God, what happened? | 00:19:29,735 | 00:19:31,362

Ross | These new kids, they never last. | 00:19:32,437 | 00:19:34,803

Ross | Sooner or later they all... | 00:19:35,073 | 00:19:37,473

Ross | ...stop lasting. | 00:19:38,177 | 00:19:39,872

Ross | What do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now? Sure. I just thought we should hang out. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us. I know. | 00:19:40,612 | 00:20:15,302

Ross | I probably shouldn't even tell you this... ...but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you. | 00:20:16,048 | 00:20:22,612

Ross | Really? | 00:20:23,789 | 00:20:24,756

Ross | Me? Oh, my God, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you... ...and I really wanted you to like me, and I... It's probably me just being totally paranoid... ...but I kind of got the feeling that maybe you don't. | 00:20:25,057 | 00:20:40,394

Ross | Well, you're not totally paranoid. When you and Ross first started going out... ...it was really hard for me... | 00:20:49,781 | 00:21:10,128

Ross | ...for many reasons of which I'm not gonna bore you with now. | 00:21:12,271 | 00:21:16,435

Ross | I see how happy he is and how good you guys are together. | 00:21:21,380 | 00:21:25,783

Ross | And Monica's always saying how nice you are... ...and God, I hate it when she's right! | 00:21:27,019 | 00:21:33,485

Ross | Thanks. Would you like to go to a movie sometime or something? Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it. I'd love it too. | 00:21:35,661 | 00:21:46,398

Ross | Shoot, I gotta go. - So I'll talk to you later. - All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch. | 00:21:47,472 | 00:22:03,186

Ross | It's not bad. | 00:22:34,486 | 00:22:35,282
