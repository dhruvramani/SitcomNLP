18
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:44,095
Excuse me.

19
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,883
Is it at all possible

20
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:51,135
that you're knitting
a pair of pants?

21
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:55,056
Oh, well, no, you're
understandably terrified.

22
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:57,692
But, you know,
allow me to explain.

23
00:00:57,694 --> 00:01:00,812
45 days ago, um,
I embarked on

24
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:02,313
a railroad journey
of healing

25
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:03,698
because my university

26
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,316
was making me do
string theory,

27
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:07,902
and my favorite comic
book store burned down,

28
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:09,737
and when my roommate
got engaged,

29
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,990
my girlfriend wanted
to move in with me,

30
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:14,659
which was no doubt
a ploy just to see my--

31
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:17,245
well, excuse my language,
but my bathing suit parts.

32
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,884
Uh, sir, may I
use your phone?

33
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:24,919
I don't think so.
Yeah, well,

34
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,671
I understand that
I'm half naked,

35
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:28,556
but there is
a reasonable explanation.

36
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:31,175
While I slept
in my sleeper car,

37
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:32,977
all my possessions were stolen.

38
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:33,979
Now,

39
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,647
typically,
I wear pajamas,

40
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:39,517
but I recently adopted
a hobo lifestyle

41
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,271
and pajamas are the
sleep-pants of the Man.

42
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,242
I'll have you know,
Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants

43
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:50,161
and a nation rallied behind him!

44
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:52,146
My good man...

45
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:53,498
Now, before you walk away...

46
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,366
I know that I may
appear deranged,

47
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:57,869
but I am, in fact,
a world-renowned physicist.

48
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:01,289
Ask me the difference
between a boson and a fermion.

49
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,507
Go ahead, ask!

50
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:07,045
Bosons have integer spin,

51
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:09,430
fermions have half-integer spin!

52
00:02:09,432 --> 00:02:10,715
My legs are getting cold!

53
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:13,484

(sniffs)

65
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:44,678
Morning.

66
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,212
Hi. Want to do
yoga with me?

67
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:47,897
Um, let me just have
some coffee first,

68
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,032
and then I'll have
the strength to tell you

69
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:52,368
how much I won't be doing that.

70
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,254
(Phone rings)

71
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:56,505
Hello?

72
00:02:56,507 --> 00:02:58,391
Hello, Leonard.

73
00:02:58,393 --> 00:03:01,344
Hey, buddy.
Good to hear your voice.

74
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:02,845
Uh, I'm in Kingman, Arizona,

75
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:06,349
and, uh, I need you
to come pick me up.

76
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:08,217
I'd love to.

77
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,886
I'm just about
to do yoga with Penny.

78
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,607
Leonard, I'm at
the police station.

79
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:15,609
I was robbed.

80
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,193
Th-They took my phone,

81
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:19,362
my wallet, my iPad, everything.

82
00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:20,563
Oh, my God, are you okay?

83
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:21,565
No,

84
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:22,648
I'm not okay.

85
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,533
I-I'm wearing borrowed pants,

86
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:26,619
I-I don't have I.D.,

87
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,037
and one of the officers here

88
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,539
won't stop calling me
Chicken Legs.

89
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,874
Okay.

90
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:33,125
Uh, I'll-I'll
come get you.

91
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:34,076
What's the address?

92
00:03:34,078 --> 00:03:35,127
Hey, what's going on?
Oh.

93
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:36,712
He got all of
his stuff stolen.

94
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:37,997
Oh...

95
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,082
Okay...

96
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:41,250
Sheldon, hang tight.

97
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:42,918
Hey, do you want me
to bring anything?

98
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,253
Oh, yes, please.

99
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:45,421
A pair of pants.

100
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:46,672
And my toothbrush.

101
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:48,341
Yeah, and my mail.

102
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:50,259
And a really good comeback
for Chicken Legs,

103
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,345
because “I know you are,
but what am I?”

104
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:55,014
was met with stony silence.

105
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:56,899
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

106
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:58,100
Is he okay?

107
00:03:58,102 --> 00:03:59,819
Yeah, he's fine, he's
just a little rattled.

108
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:00,678
Oh...

109
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:01,905
Feel like driving
to Arizona with me?

110
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:03,239
I can't, I have
that job interview.

111
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:04,607
Oh, right.
Besides,

112
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,158
I don't need six hours of
“Your hair is different.

113
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,443
“Why did you change your hair?

114
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:09,945
I'm holding my breath
until your hair grows back.”
